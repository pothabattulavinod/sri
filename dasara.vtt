WEBVTT

00:00:22.033 --> 00:00:22.733
Yamunda!

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:28.100
Never admit defeat

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:33.633
My songs will always be in your hearts
You are always with me

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:38.500
We will never part
This is true

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.766
I'm not a Rangoon kid.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:44.533
I am Rangoon Rowdy!

00:00:45.166 --> 00:00:46.566
If one Seetharama Raju dies,

00:00:46.633 --> 00:00:48.433
a million Seetharama Rajus
will be born again!

00:00:49.166 --> 00:00:52.600
My salutations to all the great people!

00:00:52.766 --> 00:00:56.733
REMEMBERING SILK SMITHA
THANK YOU, MADAM

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.333
My name is Dharani.

00:01:44.233 --> 00:01:46.466
These chimney stacks are
at the boundaries of my village.

00:01:46.733 --> 00:01:48.500
The village is surrounded
by piles of coal.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
One has to carefully look through
the smoke to find our village.

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.466
Even the air
around our village is polluted.

00:01:54.366 --> 00:01:55.466
The Lord Anjaneya.

00:01:56.066 --> 00:01:58.633
The local deity of our proletariat
and our strength.

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.700
The cacophony of bomb blasts is constant.

00:02:02.666 --> 00:02:05.033
This is our village, Veerlapalli.

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.666
VEERLAPALLI

00:02:16.166 --> 00:02:18.266
Our day starts at a bar.

00:02:26.433 --> 00:02:27.333
Bloody hell!

00:02:27.466 --> 00:02:30.333
It's been a while since daybreak,
yet he is nowhere to be found.

00:02:31.033 --> 00:02:32.133
What's the time?

00:02:41.433 --> 00:02:42.500
Every day you stop the bus here
to consume alcohol.

00:02:42.566 --> 00:02:44.300
Why do we have to face
this nuisance every day?

00:02:44.466 --> 00:02:47.333
Don't you care about your wife and kids?
What are you doing here?

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:49.166
You and your wretched addiction!

00:02:49.233 --> 00:02:51.366
- You bloody...
- Your addiction has made my life hell.

00:02:51.433 --> 00:02:52.500
Hey, I'm talking to you.

00:02:54.333 --> 00:02:55.233
Oh god!

00:02:55.633 --> 00:02:57.033
You bloody!

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:04.766
I can't anymore.

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:07.433
Will he come today or not?

00:03:17.666 --> 00:03:19.400
Everybody drinks the same alcohol,

00:03:20.133 --> 00:03:21.533
but the place where one has to drink

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.466
is based on what caste one belongs to.

00:03:24.666 --> 00:03:26.733
After watching all this,
don't think of us as addicts.

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.466
Alcohol is not an addiction for us
but an integral part of our tradition.

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:32.366
Give it to him.

00:03:34.066 --> 00:03:35.233
Hey, hold on, I'll give it to you.

00:03:35.733 --> 00:03:36.666
Give it to him.

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:46.766
Kanakayya, the owner of Silk Bar.

00:03:47.333 --> 00:03:49.066
His persona is greater than
the sarpanch of our village.

00:04:05.033 --> 00:04:06.400
- Hey, scoundrel...
- Hey!

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:12.133
I am declaring a prohibition
on alcohol consumption,

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:15.666
as per my promise
to my sisters and brothers.

00:04:34.333 --> 00:04:36.133
{\an8}Your village is doomed hereon.

00:04:39.033 --> 00:04:42.433
{\an8}Look, Silk Bar has become desolate now

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:47.133
When in pain, there's nothing to console

00:04:49.066 --> 00:04:53.466
{\an8}Without the liquor, dances
At the wedding have vanished

00:04:55.033 --> 00:04:59.166
There is no noise heard in the streets

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:04.200
There's no one seen
Accompanying the corpse now

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.500
Even when we've wept so bad
Not a single drop of tear is out

00:05:08.566 --> 00:05:12.066
Look, Silk Bar has become desolate now

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:13.400
{\an8}SADAYYA MEDICAL SHOP

00:05:13.466 --> 00:05:17.733
Sundaraiah got sick in the summer
Without liquor

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:18.700
PEOPLE'S HOSPITAL
VEERLAPALLI

00:05:18.766 --> 00:05:23.533
Somanna who nurses people
Has started drinking normal soda

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:29.266
People have ceased all activities
And started searching for alcohol

00:05:31.433 --> 00:05:35.233
No one cared about the owner of Silk Bar

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:38.500
Look, Silk Bar has become desolate now

00:05:39.666 --> 00:05:44.033
{\an8}When it is raining
People are sleeping quietly

00:05:46.033 --> 00:05:50.266
{\an8}Sales of mutton have dropped
Due to the liquor ban

00:05:52.133 --> 00:05:56.500
{\an8}Searching for a lucky drop
Of alcohol in the remaining empty bottles

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:05.566
{\an8}Radhamma lost her sleep due
To the unavailability of alcohol

00:06:10.166 --> 00:06:14.133
The baby cried for milk
And her father cried for liquor

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:17.333
Look, Silk Bar has become desolate now

00:06:17.433 --> 00:06:21.100
He locked and sealed the bar

00:06:21.433 --> 00:06:24.633
Look, Silk Bar has become desolate now

00:06:25.333 --> 00:06:29.300
May NTR be happy for wiping away our tears

00:06:29.733 --> 00:06:34.533
{\an8}By prohibiting alcohol,
he gave us the gift of better days

00:06:38.166 --> 00:06:41.466
{\an8}The image of Silk Smitha has faded away

00:06:42.033 --> 00:06:45.600
And the village has turned to dust

00:06:46.133 --> 00:06:49.333
The Silk Bar has become desolate now

00:06:56.333 --> 00:06:57.233
This is me.

00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:00.033
Suri is my best friend.

00:07:00.533 --> 00:07:01.600
He is practically the other half
of my heart.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:04.366
This is the first Dasara festival
after the alcohol ban.

00:07:05.033 --> 00:07:07.600
Nobody is happy... except me.

00:07:08.633 --> 00:07:09.533
Vennela!

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:11.233
She is also my friend.

00:07:12.166 --> 00:07:13.700
I always saw her as a friend...

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:15.466
but today,

00:07:16.033 --> 00:07:18.066
I see her as a beautiful fairy
from heaven.

00:07:20.733 --> 00:07:21.633
Hey, you rascal!

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:22.766
Why did you blow out the lamp?

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:24.400
Hey, Dharani, come here.

00:07:24.533 --> 00:07:26.666
If you do that again,
I'll thrash the hell out of you.

00:07:27.033 --> 00:07:28.000
Light this up.

00:07:45.733 --> 00:07:47.433
Hey, there's some point
of contention there, let's go!

00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:54.466
There is no dearth of alcohol.

00:07:55.433 --> 00:07:56.466
We have it in abundance.

00:07:57.133 --> 00:07:59.533
I will use my power
to bring in more liquor.

00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:02.533
What we need is
the right place to set it up.

00:08:02.666 --> 00:08:04.666
Peda Nambaiah,
The Sarpanch of our village.

00:08:04.733 --> 00:08:07.666
His stepsons,
Rajanna And Shivanna.

00:08:08.533 --> 00:08:10.300
Owning a bar was more prestigious
than being in power in his eyes.

00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:12.766
Hence he had been eyeing
it for a long time.

00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:16.700
The winner of the Sarpanch elections,
will have the sole right to own the bar.

00:08:17.166 --> 00:08:19.133
The ownership will be decided
by elections five years later.

00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:20.266
What do you say?

00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:24.233
Kanakayya realized that once he lost
the bar then he won't get it back.

00:08:24.466 --> 00:08:25.766
He resisted.

00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:28.633
But the people who were reeling
with no alcohol

00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:30.700
turned a deaf ear to Kanakayya's cry.

00:08:35.066 --> 00:08:37.266
If you want this village
to be drenched in alcohol again,

00:08:37.633 --> 00:08:39.266
have this peg
and commit your support to us.

00:08:43.266 --> 00:08:44.600
You have no other option, brother.
Agree to it.

00:08:44.666 --> 00:08:46.333
Look at how every pair of
eyes is waiting for alcohol.

00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:53.266
Kanakayya was sacrificed
to Nambaiah's politics

00:08:53.766 --> 00:08:55.333
Alcohol was the clear winner.

00:08:56.300 --> 00:08:59.066
This moment proved to be
a defining turn in Veerlapalli's story.

00:09:06.466 --> 00:09:07.633
SILK BAR

00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:12.100
Hail Lord Rama!

00:09:12.633 --> 00:09:16.733
Hail Lord Rama!

00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:20.133
Hail Lord Rama!

00:09:44.366 --> 00:09:46.233
Happy Dasara, Vennela

00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:48.200
Happy Dasara.

00:09:54.766 --> 00:09:55.700
Dharani!

00:09:59.733 --> 00:10:03.400
Oh, Mother!

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:04.766
Did you get pricked by a thorn?

00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:06.400
Yes.

00:10:06.466 --> 00:10:07.466
Don't worry, you'll be fine.

00:10:10.466 --> 00:10:15.033
As black as a piece of coal

00:10:15.333 --> 00:10:22.266
Oh, Mother!

00:10:26.033 --> 00:10:30.466
As white as a piece of chalk

00:10:36.233 --> 00:10:39.533
We hum like the buzzing honey bees

00:10:44.033 --> 00:10:46.566
We don't stop the entire day

00:10:47.466 --> 00:10:51.300
We ride the black buffalo
And roam around the whole town

00:10:51.366 --> 00:10:54.766
We forget about having food or water

00:10:55.233 --> 00:10:59.033
{\an8}In the stillness of this classroom
Writing my incoherent thoughts

00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:03.200
I'm concealing my writings
Without being noticed by anyone

00:11:03.266 --> 00:11:06.300
I await for Vennela

00:11:06.733 --> 00:11:10.633
While licking my popsicle

00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:14.566
Watching her come across
Feels like butterflies in my stomach...

00:11:23.166 --> 00:11:25.000
LOVE LETTER
I LOVE YOU VENNELA

00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:28.300
Hey!

00:11:29.533 --> 00:11:31.600
Guys, I'll tell you one thing
but don't tell anyone else.

00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:34.066
I'm in love with Vennela.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.366
That day I realized how much I loved Suri.

00:11:37.466 --> 00:11:39.500
Between Suri's friendship
and Vennela's love,

00:11:40.166 --> 00:11:41.533
I'd choose Suri over Vennela any day.

00:11:42.733 --> 00:11:44.200
Hey! You...

00:11:49.133 --> 00:11:51.200
Children! Peda Nambaiah is no more.

00:11:51.466 --> 00:11:54.133
We have declared a holiday for ten days.
Go home!

00:11:58.266 --> 00:11:59.733
Before Nambaiah's body could be cremated,

00:12:00.333 --> 00:12:02.166
the animosity between
the stepsons went public.

00:12:02.333 --> 00:12:04.000
The elders distributed the
properties amongst them,

00:12:04.066 --> 00:12:05.233
but failed to decide the fate of the bar.

00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:09.666
That's when Peda Nambaiah's words came
to their rescue.

00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:11.733
Whoever wins the sarpanch elections
keeps the bar.

00:12:13.433 --> 00:12:17.533
That one line limited
the politics of our village to one family.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:19.733
They divided the bar's flag into two,

00:12:20.133 --> 00:12:22.166
a finger-ring and an earring. They were
to be used as symbols by the two of them.

00:12:22.733 --> 00:12:24.566
Rajanna believed that the one who had
the power could own the bar.

00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:27.333
But Shivanna believed that one who used
the bar well would eventually be in power.

00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:29.200
Similarly, people were more influenced

00:12:29.366 --> 00:12:31.633
by Shivanna's distribution
of alcohol than Rajanna's word politics.

00:12:32.166 --> 00:12:33.400
Eventually, the alcohol won.

00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:35.166
The winner might be Shivanna

00:12:35.466 --> 00:12:37.666
but the one who defeated Rajanna was

00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:42.600
the only grandson of Peda Nambaiah
and son of Shivanna, Chinna Nambaiah.

00:12:48.433 --> 00:12:51.166
He is the main reason for
the defining turn in Veerlapalli's story.

00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:01.566
Wait, I'll tell you...

00:13:03.133 --> 00:13:04.066
Can't you see?

00:13:08.333 --> 00:13:09.233
Give it here.

00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:26.700
Granny, why do you drink alcohol?

00:13:28.033 --> 00:13:29.366
For courage, son.

00:13:33.066 --> 00:13:34.566
{\an8}AFTER FEW YEARS...

00:13:41.433 --> 00:13:43.666
Where is this Dharani?

00:13:43.733 --> 00:13:45.433
Don't you know about him?

00:13:45.633 --> 00:13:48.566
He will first drink and get intoxicated,

00:13:48.666 --> 00:13:51.466
only then will he come.

00:15:44.733 --> 00:15:46.700
- Hey, throw it!
- Throw it!

00:15:47.100 --> 00:15:48.366
Hey, Dharani, throw it.

00:15:48.433 --> 00:15:49.433
Dharani!

00:15:50.300 --> 00:15:51.600
Hey, throw it!

00:15:52.433 --> 00:15:54.033
Hey, throw it!

00:16:07.633 --> 00:16:08.733
Come on, throw it!

00:16:16.733 --> 00:16:18.166
Come on, throw it!

00:17:12.066 --> 00:17:17.066
We are either completely
Sober or extremely high

00:17:17.666 --> 00:17:23.300
All we do is drink, eat, and sleep

00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:28.433
Fight with us and get
Your head beaten to a pulp!

00:17:39.766 --> 00:17:41.600
Hey, stop it.

00:17:42.233 --> 00:17:43.233
You fools!

00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:45.166
You and your bloody chorale.

00:17:45.333 --> 00:17:47.266
Hey, give them one more bottle of liquor.

00:17:47.433 --> 00:17:49.333
I'll see how they don't beat their drums.

00:17:54.533 --> 00:18:00.000
Have a peg, have a peg
Have some lamb to go along with it

00:18:05.300 --> 00:18:07.733
Beat the drums
Beat the drums

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.300
Make people get up
And dance vigorously to that music

00:18:10.366 --> 00:18:13.066
Let's get the heavens down!

00:18:13.133 --> 00:18:15.600
Let's have some drinks
And make merry at this Silk Bar

00:18:15.666 --> 00:18:20.333
Get ready to rock and shatter the
Dance floor let's see who dares to stop us

00:18:20.466 --> 00:18:21.366
Bloody hell!

00:18:21.433 --> 00:18:26.400
We celebrate friendship and
The whole village fears our faction

00:18:26.466 --> 00:18:32.666
We celebrate friendship and
The whole village fears our faction

00:18:53.133 --> 00:18:55.500
Ration rice along with
Chilies is what we eat

00:18:55.566 --> 00:18:58.366
Friendship is the only asset we possess

00:19:03.266 --> 00:19:05.633
We consider coal from
The ground to be our gold

00:19:05.700 --> 00:19:08.266
We live amongst people
With hearts of gold.

00:19:08.333 --> 00:19:10.633
This village which provides
Us with food is our mother

00:19:10.700 --> 00:19:13.266
The trains which provide
Us livelihood is our father

00:19:13.333 --> 00:19:15.400
We bath along the buffaloes in our lake

00:19:15.466 --> 00:19:18.266
We have never heard the
Crowing of a rooster! Bloody hell!

00:19:18.333 --> 00:19:23.433
We celebrate friendship and
The whole village fears our faction

00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:28.500
We celebrate friendship and
The whole village fears our faction

00:19:28.566 --> 00:19:30.766
We celebrate!
We celebrate!

00:19:38.133 --> 00:19:42.733
A Barbie doll
The beautiful creation of the Lord

00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:49.400
How did we find this
Pretty lady in this village?

00:19:51.233 --> 00:19:56.166
Seetha had gone to fetch water

00:19:57.700 --> 00:20:02.600
And she came across
Rama in this village

00:20:04.366 --> 00:20:09.500
One must live like crazy
Life should have some spice

00:20:14.466 --> 00:20:19.466
Suck the bone marrow out of goat bones
Don't eat the bland lentils

00:20:19.533 --> 00:20:24.433
We wear a dhoti as a staple.
We don't care about anything in our lives

00:20:24.500 --> 00:20:27.100
-We drink Ambali but
-We live a King's life

00:20:27.166 --> 00:20:29.433
-Every day is Dasara for us
-Bloody hell!

00:20:29.500 --> 00:20:34.566
We celebrate friendship and
The whole village fears our faction

00:20:34.633 --> 00:20:39.666
We celebrate friendship and
The whole village fears our faction

00:20:39.733 --> 00:20:42.100
We celebrate!
We celebrate!

00:21:17.066 --> 00:21:18.000
Bloody!

00:21:31.166 --> 00:21:32.666
What are we doing here?

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:35.466
Nothing, dude. We got tipsy
in the morning after having a few drinks

00:21:35.533 --> 00:21:36.566
and thrashed a policeman
in an intoxicated state.

00:21:38.300 --> 00:21:39.533
Manhandling a police officer is illegal,
right?

00:21:40.100 --> 00:21:41.333
That's why we are behind bars.

00:21:41.433 --> 00:21:42.500
Did you beat a police officer?

00:21:42.766 --> 00:21:44.133
Didn't I stop you?

00:21:44.466 --> 00:21:46.433
You, bloody!
You get sloshed after drinking,

00:21:46.533 --> 00:21:48.200
thrash everyone in an intoxicated state,

00:21:48.266 --> 00:21:50.166
then once you are sober,
you act as if nothing ever happened.

00:21:50.333 --> 00:21:51.333
What is this nuisance, dude?

00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:52.500
Call those boys.

00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:55.166
Come here! Come!

00:21:55.300 --> 00:21:58.233
You are doomed today.
He is going to take you to task now!

00:21:58.433 --> 00:22:00.366
Sir, he's the one who thrashed me.

00:22:01.766 --> 00:22:02.766
Get me that lathi.

00:22:05.166 --> 00:22:07.100
Hey, it will be used on us.
You senseless idiot.

00:22:10.066 --> 00:22:10.766
Sir,

00:22:12.033 --> 00:22:13.200
I swear on my grandma,

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:16.200
one hit of that lathi
and I'm going fall dead on the ground.

00:22:16.733 --> 00:22:18.366
There will be no second chance to beat me.

00:22:19.433 --> 00:22:21.166
Straight to the graveyard

00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:23.566
Please let me go, sir.

00:22:25.133 --> 00:22:26.466
I beg you, sir.

00:22:27.333 --> 00:22:28.433
You fool!

00:22:28.633 --> 00:22:30.133
Are you sure he is the one?

00:22:30.700 --> 00:22:32.266
He pissed his pants just
at the sight of a lathi.

00:22:32.500 --> 00:22:33.400
Get lost.

00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:34.666
Hey, move! Let's go!

00:22:34.733 --> 00:22:36.666
What a waste of time early in the morning.

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:40.733
He acts as a daredevil when high
and a cowardly fellow when sober.

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:41.700
Move!

00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:44.500
COURTYARD SHELTER

00:23:22.500 --> 00:23:24.233
Hey, Suri!

00:23:25.700 --> 00:23:26.633
What are you doing here?

00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:30.600
Bro, greetings!

00:23:31.533 --> 00:23:33.300
How's everyone in your family?

00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:35.533
I'm Vennela.

00:23:37.433 --> 00:23:38.466
First, get that beedi out.

00:23:38.633 --> 00:23:41.500
Aren't you ashamed of stealing coal and
then ending up spending nights in jail?

00:23:41.566 --> 00:23:42.466
Shut up.

00:23:42.566 --> 00:23:45.300
You are stealing the eggs meant
for children and giving us a moral lesson?

00:23:45.366 --> 00:23:46.266
Shut up.

00:23:46.333 --> 00:23:50.033
Two thieves never discuss their exploits
with each other.

00:23:50.500 --> 00:23:51.533
Tell me, why are you here?

00:23:53.233 --> 00:23:54.266
To get a kiss from you.

00:23:54.766 --> 00:23:56.200
- Kiss?
- Yes.

00:23:56.566 --> 00:23:59.200
You are asking for a kiss,
not a bidi from a shop.

00:23:59.300 --> 00:24:00.200
Hey...

00:24:00.300 --> 00:24:02.666
- will you give me a kiss or not?
- I will not. Get lost.

00:24:03.133 --> 00:24:05.666
How dare you reject Suri's request!

00:24:05.733 --> 00:24:07.766
Suri, kiss her. I'll guard the entrance.

00:24:08.033 --> 00:24:10.000
Dharani, you had it from me.

00:24:10.333 --> 00:24:11.566
I'm going to see your end.

00:24:17.066 --> 00:24:20.300
Suri, let me go.

00:24:20.766 --> 00:24:22.666
Otherwise,
I'm going to kill you today.

00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:27.366
Vennela? Vennela?

00:24:28.733 --> 00:24:31.133
Stop! You, cowards.

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:33.466
Hurry up, the man who conducts
the census is here.

00:24:33.533 --> 00:24:35.233
Coming.

00:24:38.466 --> 00:24:40.033
Bloody, pain.

00:24:41.433 --> 00:24:45.166
- Is Suri at home, mother-in-law?
- Don't call me mother-in-law, you witch.

00:24:45.366 --> 00:24:47.400
Let us get married.
I'll deal with you then.

00:24:50.233 --> 00:24:51.133
Sister!

00:24:52.033 --> 00:24:52.733
Vennela!

00:24:53.533 --> 00:24:56.700
This is the new voter list for the
upcoming elections. Give it to Shivanna.

00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:57.700
Okay.

00:25:00.733 --> 00:25:02.600
Uncle, Vennela passed this on.

00:25:13.333 --> 00:25:14.466
Nambi...

00:25:15.666 --> 00:25:18.600
this time we have 150 new voters.

00:25:19.466 --> 00:25:20.666
The young guys must remember

00:25:20.733 --> 00:25:23.133
only the ring symbol when they
come to vote for the first time.

00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:26.466
I'll start the promotions
tomorrow itself, Dad.

00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:29.733
Let's begin with the cricket match.

00:25:30.233 --> 00:25:33.300
Every player must wear the ring.

00:25:33.566 --> 00:25:36.766
This time, even Rajanna's soul must
shiver

00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:38.266
to file a nomination against us.

00:25:41.366 --> 00:25:42.700
The cashier's post.

00:25:45.466 --> 00:25:47.233
Let's fire the old man,

00:25:48.300 --> 00:25:50.133
who is the cashier at the bar.

00:25:51.266 --> 00:25:52.766
The oldie occupying the
cashier's post is of no use to us.

00:25:54.733 --> 00:25:56.400
Announce that the winner
of the match will be the new cashier.

00:25:57.233 --> 00:25:58.700
They will go crazy.

00:25:59.433 --> 00:26:02.600
Once they wear the ring,
the ring will come off

00:26:04.066 --> 00:26:05.533
only along with their finger.

00:26:13.466 --> 00:26:15.233
This time I'll contest the elections, Dad.

00:26:21.166 --> 00:26:23.733
Hereby, the news given to the villagers is
that as always

00:26:24.433 --> 00:26:27.600
this time as well there will be
a cricket tournament.

00:26:27.766 --> 00:26:30.300
The contest, named after Peda Nambaiah,

00:26:30.566 --> 00:26:32.266
will have a winning prize of 1500 rupees

00:26:32.333 --> 00:26:35.166
and the winners can drink as much
alcohol as they wish to at Silk Bar.

00:26:35.333 --> 00:26:37.166
{\an8}Not just that,

00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:41.700
one member from the winning team would
be appointed to be the cashier of the bar.

00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:44.533
So, young and energetic boys

00:26:45.033 --> 00:26:49.533
are expected to utilize this
golden opportunity to the fullest.

00:26:55.300 --> 00:26:56.533
- Sister?
- Yes.

00:26:56.600 --> 00:26:59.500
Get me another ten eggs tomorrow.

00:27:01.366 --> 00:27:03.600
You don't need to go to school anymore.
You can stay at home.

00:27:03.666 --> 00:27:05.033
The groom's family will come to see you.

00:27:05.533 --> 00:27:06.433
Here, have it.

00:27:06.500 --> 00:27:07.633
Did I ask you to look for a match for me?

00:27:11.066 --> 00:27:11.766
Here drink.

00:27:12.100 --> 00:27:13.733
This match is from a good family,
we don't need your consent to call them.

00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:19.300
I love Suri and I'll marry only him.

00:27:19.366 --> 00:27:20.266
Shut up.

00:27:20.333 --> 00:27:23.433
I'll thrash both your cheeks
if I hear his name in this house again!

00:27:26.100 --> 00:27:27.033
It is because of this behavior of yours

00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:28.700
that your father arranged a match for you.

00:27:29.166 --> 00:27:30.700
Shut up and marry the one we've arranged
for you.

00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:37.733
- Hey, come on...
- Wait...

00:27:38.533 --> 00:27:39.766
Vennela is here.

00:27:46.233 --> 00:27:48.300
What are you doing
here at such a late hour?

00:27:48.533 --> 00:27:51.300
There are a few people who take a piss
in their bed

00:27:51.666 --> 00:27:52.733
because they are afraid of darkness.

00:27:55.533 --> 00:27:56.500
Hey, stop it guys.

00:27:57.600 --> 00:27:58.666
Why are you here this late?

00:27:59.533 --> 00:28:00.766
I am expecting a match tomorrow.

00:28:01.533 --> 00:28:03.300
He works at Singareni.

00:28:03.366 --> 00:28:07.233
I knew that mother
of yours was an opportunist!

00:28:07.300 --> 00:28:09.600
Hey, stop interfering in our matter!

00:28:10.533 --> 00:28:13.166
If he likes me,

00:28:13.500 --> 00:28:15.300
my folks are going
to get me married to him.

00:28:15.366 --> 00:28:18.300
Shut up. Stop dragging
your mother between us.

00:28:18.433 --> 00:28:20.200
If you really like me,
convince your mother first,

00:28:20.366 --> 00:28:22.600
or else come, I'll marry
you right here, right now.

00:28:23.466 --> 00:28:24.466
Pour some more for me.

00:28:29.266 --> 00:28:31.266
We've been loving each
other since childhood,

00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:36.600
only when you realize
that I'm not your girl anymore,

00:28:38.033 --> 00:28:39.600
will you understand my pain.

00:28:41.433 --> 00:28:44.733
If something untoward happens,
I'm going to kill myself.

00:28:47.333 --> 00:28:48.300
Don't talk about such things.

00:28:49.566 --> 00:28:51.300
Where are you going?

00:28:51.533 --> 00:28:52.433
I'll come back.

00:28:58.666 --> 00:29:00.500
Hey Dharani... Dharani!

00:29:04.266 --> 00:29:05.666
Dude, no, listen to me. Let's go back.

00:29:09.633 --> 00:29:12.100
What is it? Why are you here?

00:29:13.433 --> 00:29:15.133
Come back.

00:29:17.066 --> 00:29:19.166
Forget about me.

00:29:19.700 --> 00:29:21.166
Where is Vennela, Aunty?

00:29:22.100 --> 00:29:24.333
Where will she be?
She's sleeping inside.

00:29:24.400 --> 00:29:27.600
She's not there. She's with Suri,
both busy romancing each other.

00:29:27.666 --> 00:29:29.133
What nonsense are you talking about?

00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:30.100
Look at this.

00:29:32.266 --> 00:29:33.266
This is ours.

00:29:33.500 --> 00:29:35.366
Listen to me, Aunty.
Get them both married.

00:29:36.633 --> 00:29:39.500
How will a jobless fellow
take care of my daughter?

00:29:39.566 --> 00:29:43.066
I would rather get her killed
than get her married to that guy.

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:46.100
So you won't get them married?

00:29:46.433 --> 00:29:47.333
I won't.

00:29:49.500 --> 00:29:51.466
- What is happening here?
- Hello, Mummy.

00:29:53.533 --> 00:29:54.466
So, you won't do it?

00:29:55.166 --> 00:29:56.100
Not at all.

00:29:56.666 --> 00:29:57.600
You!

00:29:58.766 --> 00:30:01.333
Everyone, listen up!

00:30:04.333 --> 00:30:06.766
If she won't get Suri and Vennela married,

00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:09.433
I will jump in this well and die.

00:30:09.700 --> 00:30:11.533
Did you see that?

00:30:12.033 --> 00:30:13.000
He is blackmailing us.

00:30:13.066 --> 00:30:15.200
Shall I give away my daughter
to coal thieves?

00:30:15.266 --> 00:30:18.066
My daughter is a primary teacher.
Primary teacher!

00:30:18.666 --> 00:30:19.600
Really?

00:30:20.266 --> 00:30:21.466
Bullshit...

00:30:22.533 --> 00:30:24.566
We are going to win
the cricket tournament.

00:30:25.133 --> 00:30:27.600
We will get appointed to the post
of cashier at Silk Bar,

00:30:27.666 --> 00:30:29.033
who every man of
Veerlapalli respects the most.

00:30:31.733 --> 00:30:33.266
Will you give your daughter to Suri then?

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:34.766
What?

00:30:35.266 --> 00:30:36.433
The bar cashier?

00:30:37.033 --> 00:30:37.766
Dharani...

00:30:38.766 --> 00:30:43.366
if he becomes the cashier of the bar,
I'm going to give my daughter to him.

00:30:43.466 --> 00:30:47.066
I'll arrange a grand marriage
and bless the newlyweds.

00:30:47.133 --> 00:30:48.400
That's how it is done!

00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:52.000
What about you, Aunty?

00:30:52.466 --> 00:30:53.366
Okay.

00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:56.400
I agree to it as we both are
from the same caste anyway.

00:31:00.733 --> 00:31:03.366
Suri! Suri, they agreed to your marriage.

00:31:03.500 --> 00:31:06.000
Her mother didn't agree at first,
but Dharani has cast his magic somehow.

00:31:08.300 --> 00:31:09.700
Hey, what is this?

00:31:13.533 --> 00:31:16.533
If you ever raise your voice

00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:18.666
at Suri?

00:31:22.533 --> 00:31:23.433
Don't.

00:31:27.733 --> 00:31:30.700
Because he is your husband.

00:31:33.166 --> 00:31:34.366
It's time to celebrate.

00:31:34.433 --> 00:31:36.200
- It's time to celebrate.
- Hey, Dharani!

00:31:36.266 --> 00:31:38.233
We are on top of this world!

00:31:58.200 --> 00:32:00.133
Call Dharani to the bar.

00:32:07.366 --> 00:32:08.700
Did you come already?

00:32:12.633 --> 00:32:15.766
Brother, you asked him to come,
didn't you?

00:32:16.366 --> 00:32:17.300
He has come.

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:26.766
Did you call me, brother?

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:30.700
Yes...

00:32:31.733 --> 00:32:34.333
You seem to play cricket well.

00:32:34.766 --> 00:32:35.666
Yes, sir.

00:32:36.466 --> 00:32:38.233
Then, what will happen
if you don't play tomorrow's match?

00:32:38.300 --> 00:32:40.633
What will happen? The whole team will get
out within five overs, sir.

00:32:40.700 --> 00:32:41.666
And Sai would become the cashier.

00:32:42.300 --> 00:32:43.333
That is what I want.

00:32:44.566 --> 00:32:46.100
Sai is our new cashier.

00:32:51.266 --> 00:32:52.166
Brother...

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:55.700
What is it?

00:32:56.733 --> 00:32:58.066
I have to win tomorrow's
match at any cost.

00:32:58.266 --> 00:32:59.533
I promised Suri
that I would get his marriage fixed.

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:04.200
Now, imagine you are returning home
on your cycle

00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:06.633
and a truck crashes into you on the way.

00:33:07.566 --> 00:33:09.700
If you die in that mishap,

00:33:10.300 --> 00:33:11.333
will you possibly play tomorrow's match?

00:33:16.633 --> 00:33:20.266
You don't have any respect
for my word, do you?

00:33:22.333 --> 00:33:24.566
He is petrified! Bloody, coward!

00:33:44.700 --> 00:33:47.533
Hey, why are you dancing?
Catch the ball.

00:33:54.066 --> 00:33:54.766
I can't.

00:33:55.033 --> 00:33:56.433
Play properly, Darani!

00:33:59.766 --> 00:34:00.766
Out!

00:34:06.633 --> 00:34:08.166
Can't you field properly?

00:34:09.366 --> 00:34:10.333
- Go...
- Play properly!

00:34:10.400 --> 00:34:12.666
I beg you. Please catch
the ball when it comes to you.

00:34:22.333 --> 00:34:23.533
Go, stand there.

00:34:25.300 --> 00:34:26.300
What the...

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:32.233
What happened to him?

00:34:39.699 --> 00:34:40.600
Hey...

00:34:43.666 --> 00:34:45.133
What happened to him?

00:34:49.166 --> 00:34:50.466
RUNS 224
WICKETS 04

00:34:50.666 --> 00:34:51.600
Bloody! We've lost it.

00:34:52.433 --> 00:34:53.733
They have made a big score, man.

00:34:54.333 --> 00:34:57.500
Dharani, we have to bat
deep to chase the score.

00:34:58.466 --> 00:35:00.766
Bro, I can't. Don't
you see my condition?

00:35:01.100 --> 00:35:02.733
Dude, how will we
win if you won't play?

00:35:03.266 --> 00:35:04.233
Can't you see?

00:35:04.700 --> 00:35:05.600
How can he play?

00:35:07.133 --> 00:35:09.400
Let's play our best, we shall
either win or lose, and that's it.

00:35:12.533 --> 00:35:13.433
You, come with me.

00:35:46.033 --> 00:35:47.466
Suri! Suri!

00:36:21.266 --> 00:36:22.633
You raised my mother's hopes for nothing

00:36:22.700 --> 00:36:23.766
by mentioning the bar
and the cashier position.

00:36:24.633 --> 00:36:26.266
Now, look what's happened.
My mother won't ever look at Suri again.

00:36:27.066 --> 00:36:28.566
I would have found some
other way to marry him.

00:36:30.100 --> 00:36:31.566
She would have succumbed
to my grief at least.

00:36:33.100 --> 00:36:34.500
After these many years
of our relationship,

00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:39.166
one match is going to decide our fate.

00:36:45.033 --> 00:36:45.733
Damn!

00:36:51.333 --> 00:36:52.233
Hey, get the money.

00:36:59.466 --> 00:37:02.466
He's gonna rip you apart

00:37:02.566 --> 00:37:05.466
He has set the bar so high
That no one can reach him

00:37:05.533 --> 00:37:08.433
He's gonna break your bones
As easily as breaking crockery

00:37:08.500 --> 00:37:11.600
Oh God, no one can stop him
While he's hitting all around the world

00:37:23.500 --> 00:37:28.533
Keep calm and watch him roar

00:37:28.600 --> 00:37:31.600
When the ball is dancing on his bat

00:37:31.700 --> 00:37:34.200
Just watch him till the sun goes down

00:37:35.500 --> 00:37:38.400
He's gonna rip you apart

00:37:38.566 --> 00:37:41.500
He has set the bar so high
That no one can reach him

00:37:47.466 --> 00:37:48.366
If he pulls up his lungi

00:37:48.433 --> 00:37:50.466
You are gonna witness
a raging bull on the ground

00:37:50.533 --> 00:37:53.466
When he's high after getting drunk

00:37:53.533 --> 00:37:56.600
You will witness Shiva's tandava
On the pitch

00:37:59.100 --> 00:38:00.300
Oh, no!

00:38:01.100 --> 00:38:03.233
He's a rising phoenix

00:38:03.333 --> 00:38:06.300
Start playing drums

00:38:07.100 --> 00:38:12.300
As he rips everyone apart

00:38:24.633 --> 00:38:27.200
Dharani is on the top

00:38:27.333 --> 00:38:30.166
You better step back

00:38:30.300 --> 00:38:33.166
He is gonna kick you out

00:38:33.333 --> 00:38:36.300
Try to stop him if you're a man!

00:38:50.600 --> 00:38:52.366
Greetings, everyone!

00:38:53.166 --> 00:38:55.633
The peculiarity of this tournament

00:38:56.266 --> 00:38:59.000
is the post of cashier!

00:39:01.033 --> 00:39:02.366
Who is going to get
that post from your team?

00:39:02.533 --> 00:39:06.600
- Suri! Suri!
- Suri! Suri!

00:39:06.700 --> 00:39:10.100
- Suri! Suri!
- Suri! Suri!

00:39:10.166 --> 00:39:12.766
- Suri! Suri!
- Suri! Suri!

00:39:17.100 --> 00:39:22.000
When I started in politics,
one man took great efforts to separate us.

00:39:22.366 --> 00:39:23.433
But you...

00:39:24.200 --> 00:39:27.633
you proved that the villagers
and the ring are inseparable.

00:39:28.133 --> 00:39:31.266
No, you gave him a befitting reply
with your actions.

00:39:32.100 --> 00:39:34.533
The idea of giving the cashier position
to the winner

00:39:35.100 --> 00:39:37.133
didn't occur to me but to Nambi
and I'm proud of him.

00:39:37.266 --> 00:39:40.066
- Long live...
- Brother Nambi!

00:39:40.133 --> 00:39:42.033
I hereby announce that Chinna Nambaiah

00:39:42.500 --> 00:39:45.533
will be our candidate for
the next sarpanch elections.

00:39:45.600 --> 00:39:48.100
- Long live...
- Brother Nambi!

00:39:48.166 --> 00:39:49.300
Hey, come on the stage.

00:39:49.366 --> 00:39:50.366
Long live!

00:40:21.266 --> 00:40:23.233
I was searching for you all around.
What are you doing here?

00:40:23.766 --> 00:40:25.600
Suri and Vennela just went away.

00:40:26.133 --> 00:40:27.733
So you were providing security to them?

00:40:29.266 --> 00:40:30.666
Now they don't need you.

00:40:31.233 --> 00:40:33.000
It doesn't matter if someone sees them.

00:40:33.166 --> 00:40:34.733
But I know you won't pay heed to my words.

00:40:36.300 --> 00:40:37.600
Anyway, I must admit

00:40:37.700 --> 00:40:40.366
that because of you Suri is
in the best phase of his life.

00:40:40.733 --> 00:40:41.633
Yes!

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:43.533
Even she is very happy.

00:40:45.600 --> 00:40:46.500
Is it?

00:40:46.566 --> 00:40:47.633
Are you playing dumb?

00:40:48.566 --> 00:40:49.466
You didn't notice her happiness?

00:40:51.133 --> 00:40:53.733
Tell me something,
did you really forget her?

00:40:55.233 --> 00:40:56.200
Of course.

00:40:57.533 --> 00:40:59.166
So you don't have any problem
with their marriage?

00:41:02.466 --> 00:41:03.733
It's Suri's marriage.

00:41:05.166 --> 00:41:08.266
It should be the talk of the town.

00:41:08.633 --> 00:41:10.400
So you've really forgotten all
about her?

00:41:14.133 --> 00:41:15.033
Yes!

00:41:16.066 --> 00:41:18.266
I have moved on from her.
Don't irritate me!

00:41:19.666 --> 00:41:22.300
How did you deduce that she was there just
by listening to her anklets?

00:41:23.533 --> 00:41:24.566
Just because she was upset,

00:41:25.133 --> 00:41:26.433
why did you go and talk
to her family instead of Suri?

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:30.500
I pleaded with you to forget
about her but you won't.

00:41:32.500 --> 00:41:34.566
At least share your feelings
with Suri but you won't do that either.

00:41:36.166 --> 00:41:37.066
If you didn't dare to express your love

00:41:37.133 --> 00:41:38.133
why the heck did you even love her?

00:41:40.266 --> 00:41:41.200
Damn!

00:41:42.266 --> 00:41:43.433
Do you remember?

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:45.466
It was you who first loved Vennela.

00:41:48.100 --> 00:41:50.433
But now you are only concerned
about Suri's marriage, aren't you?

00:41:51.200 --> 00:41:52.500
But the bride is Vennela, dude!

00:41:55.600 --> 00:41:56.500
Go to hell,

00:41:57.133 --> 00:41:58.100
bloody rascal!

00:42:43.566 --> 00:42:46.600
Hey Kiddo, that girl is not yours

00:42:47.533 --> 00:42:50.600
Let it go now, your paths have separated

00:42:51.533 --> 00:42:54.666
Find solace in your mother's lap

00:42:55.533 --> 00:42:58.566
Turn into a child, and forget everything

00:42:58.700 --> 00:43:02.600
Childhood is so amazing
Every pain is temporary

00:43:02.666 --> 00:43:06.566
When a kid is insistent
On touching the moon

00:43:06.666 --> 00:43:10.600
He is easily distracted by showing a candy

00:43:10.666 --> 00:43:15.433
Adulthood is evil
It exclaims the truth out loud

00:43:15.500 --> 00:43:19.133
Hey kiddo, that girl is not yours

00:43:19.533 --> 00:43:23.300
Go to sleep like a small baby

00:43:58.666 --> 00:44:02.033
I have loved you

00:44:02.633 --> 00:44:06.500
Like a devotee worships a deity's idol

00:44:06.700 --> 00:44:10.266
I've contained myself to a boundary

00:44:11.033 --> 00:44:14.600
Such that I would stay away from you

00:44:14.666 --> 00:44:18.400
I've turned the blazing agony

00:44:18.666 --> 00:44:22.366
Into the flame of the sacred oil lamp

00:44:22.700 --> 00:44:26.700
I've bid farewell to the consecrated idol

00:44:27.066 --> 00:44:30.700
Of the deity in my tears

00:44:31.066 --> 00:44:34.333
I sent it, I've left it

00:45:09.233 --> 00:45:13.266
Like a wingless fly stuck in a whirlwind

00:45:13.333 --> 00:45:17.266
Like a baffled man's helpless cry

00:45:17.333 --> 00:45:19.633
With no possibility of uniting with you

00:45:19.700 --> 00:45:21.633
And the incapability of
Staying away from you

00:45:21.700 --> 00:45:24.166
My life's a ruin!

00:45:25.300 --> 00:45:29.233
The wounded heart feels
The salt being rubbed on the injuries

00:45:29.300 --> 00:45:33.166
But such is my life that
I can't shriek in pain!

00:46:27.400 --> 00:46:30.666
The flag on Rajanna's
house is being lowered.

00:46:34.066 --> 00:46:36.566
That means Nambanna wins unanimously.

00:46:37.233 --> 00:46:41.400
Yeah, he couldn't face the public
when he lost to his younger brother.

00:46:41.466 --> 00:46:42.666
Now if he loses
to his brother's son as well,

00:46:42.733 --> 00:46:44.333
the humiliation he will have
to face will be tenfold.

00:46:44.400 --> 00:46:45.300
In his boxers.

00:46:47.500 --> 00:46:48.466
Hey, Cashier.

00:46:49.200 --> 00:46:50.133
One more bottle.

00:46:51.700 --> 00:46:53.766
Do you have some kind
of sponge in your stomach?

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:04.733
Give me a full bottle.

00:47:07.233 --> 00:47:08.133
Hey!

00:47:08.666 --> 00:47:10.000
Why did you come in?

00:47:10.366 --> 00:47:11.266
Okay, let that go.

00:47:11.400 --> 00:47:12.633
Oh, you must have remembered who you are,
right?

00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:14.400
Seeing you roaming
with those pigs all these days,

00:47:14.466 --> 00:47:16.133
I thought you were one among them.

00:47:16.666 --> 00:47:19.033
You are discriminating against my friends
on the basis of their caste,

00:47:19.533 --> 00:47:20.766
what kind of shit-eating pig are you?

00:47:21.466 --> 00:47:22.366
Hey!

00:47:22.600 --> 00:47:24.000
Stop your nuisance.

00:47:24.433 --> 00:47:26.000
From tomorrow, I will be the cashier.

00:47:26.633 --> 00:47:29.033
I'll speak with Nambi bro
and get all of them inside.

00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:30.766
You will be the cashier?

00:47:31.133 --> 00:47:32.133
Dharani took a full bottle

00:47:32.233 --> 00:47:33.633
as a bribe to make you lose the match.
Didn't he tell you yet?

00:47:33.700 --> 00:47:36.133
Seems he's a cashier.

00:47:39.766 --> 00:47:40.700
Hey,

00:47:41.100 --> 00:47:43.100
if it was enough to scare him,
he would have lost.

00:47:43.366 --> 00:47:45.233
But you gave him alcohol,
which backfired on you.

00:47:46.100 --> 00:47:47.700
This is what digging your own grave means.

00:47:48.400 --> 00:47:49.633
You...

00:47:49.766 --> 00:47:51.400
- Hey...
- What?

00:47:56.200 --> 00:47:57.666
Bloody hell!

00:48:15.700 --> 00:48:19.766
VOTE FOR RING

00:49:33.733 --> 00:49:35.566
How dare you! You bloody idiot!

00:49:45.400 --> 00:49:46.333
Sir.

00:49:47.033 --> 00:49:48.000
Please, sir.

00:49:52.533 --> 00:49:53.633
Sir?

00:49:54.133 --> 00:49:56.633
Sir! Let us go, sir.
I beg you, sir.

00:49:56.733 --> 00:49:58.100
Sir, let us go. I beg you, sir.

00:50:01.100 --> 00:50:02.666
- Sir, please let me see my son once.
- Hey, old man, move aside. Go sit there.

00:50:04.233 --> 00:50:05.133
Sir!

00:50:06.033 --> 00:50:07.700
- Sir!
- Sir, please no sir... please

00:50:08.566 --> 00:50:10.766
Sir, I beg you, sir.

00:50:11.766 --> 00:50:12.666
Hey! Sir!

00:50:23.700 --> 00:50:24.633
Rajanna!

00:50:25.266 --> 00:50:26.233
Rajanna!

00:50:29.766 --> 00:50:30.666
Rajanna.

00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:25.366
POLICE STATION
KAMANPUR

00:51:25.433 --> 00:51:27.000
Hello, Rajanna.
How come you are here?

00:51:31.466 --> 00:51:32.766
These are substandard people, Rajanna.

00:51:33.366 --> 00:51:35.066
They wrecked the bar.

00:51:35.500 --> 00:51:36.700
Bloody fools.

00:51:38.400 --> 00:51:40.466
Look, Rajanna. I will tell you the truth.

00:51:40.566 --> 00:51:42.133
Shivanna has instructed me not
to let them go.

00:51:42.433 --> 00:51:43.400
I'm not going to let them go.

00:51:46.566 --> 00:51:49.333
I want my boys
to be released within five minutes.

00:51:50.366 --> 00:51:51.266
Rajanna...

00:51:55.133 --> 00:51:58.733
It won't take me more than five minutes
to wreck this police station.

00:52:00.666 --> 00:52:02.633
You might be scared that you will have
to face consequences

00:52:02.700 --> 00:52:04.000
from Shivanna's people
if you release them.

00:52:05.233 --> 00:52:08.200
But if you won't release them, trust me,
the consequences will be much worse.

00:52:33.766 --> 00:52:36.400
We thought we would never be released,
Rajanna.

00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:38.266
They thrashed us badly, Rajanna.

00:52:39.666 --> 00:52:41.333
We would forever be indebted
to you, Rajanna.

00:52:45.566 --> 00:52:48.100
Contest in this time's election, Rajanna.

00:52:50.233 --> 00:52:51.266
Are you crazy?

00:52:51.533 --> 00:52:52.466
Hey!

00:52:52.533 --> 00:52:54.666
Shut up and sit there. Go.

00:52:56.000 --> 00:52:57.766
Go to hell, idiots. Do as you wish.

00:53:01.466 --> 00:53:02.533
You must contest, Rajanna.

00:53:12.600 --> 00:53:16.500
Go have something to eat and go to sleep.

00:53:18.766 --> 00:53:19.666
No, sir.

00:53:20.566 --> 00:53:21.566
This time we have your back

00:53:21.766 --> 00:53:23.166
Where were you all these years?

00:53:23.433 --> 00:53:25.533
Now that Rajanna has helped out,
he's suddenly become a God for you?

00:53:25.700 --> 00:53:28.766
Go and accept that cashier's post
and lick Nambi's boots. Go.

00:53:29.166 --> 00:53:30.066
You came to him when you needed help.

00:53:30.133 --> 00:53:32.433
I will get the post on licking his boots.

00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:33.733
But I don't want a life

00:53:34.366 --> 00:53:36.633
where I will be inside
and my friends will have to stay outside.

00:53:39.100 --> 00:53:40.666
We never voted for Rajanna.

00:53:41.200 --> 00:53:42.166
I agree it's our mistake.

00:53:43.300 --> 00:53:44.466
But not this time.

00:53:45.066 --> 00:53:46.033
We shall make you win, sir.

00:53:47.733 --> 00:53:51.466
I came here to help you

00:53:52.266 --> 00:53:53.766
and not for my political benefits.

00:53:54.433 --> 00:53:56.366
You will be called a good man
for helping others in need.

00:53:57.466 --> 00:53:59.633
Politicize your helping,

00:54:00.333 --> 00:54:01.466
you will be called the Sarpanch.

00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:06.133
Dude, can we beat the bar?

00:54:06.566 --> 00:54:10.500
Everyone has forgotten that
the bar belongs to the election winner.

00:54:13.033 --> 00:54:14.733
Let's remind everyone about the same.

00:54:17.333 --> 00:54:18.266
Agree to it, Rajanna.

00:54:30.500 --> 00:54:33.000
Losing is not new to me.

00:54:34.100 --> 00:54:36.133
But this time,
I'll contest the elections for your sake.

00:54:51.566 --> 00:54:54.600
Now onwards,
travel with your windows lowered, Rajanna.

00:55:28.266 --> 00:55:34.233
Long live Shivanna!

00:55:34.300 --> 00:55:39.000
Long live Shivanna!

00:55:49.466 --> 00:55:51.300
{\an8}If someone asks me, "Are you afraid
to stand with your friends?"

00:55:51.366 --> 00:55:54.266
{\an8}If necessary, I will drink a full bottle
to gather courage and support my friend.

00:55:54.500 --> 00:55:55.733
Let it happen as it is meant to be.

00:56:48.733 --> 00:56:52.733
Who stepped inside the bar after you?

00:56:54.300 --> 00:56:55.233
Dharani.

00:56:56.533 --> 00:56:57.433
Sign the nominations.

00:57:01.200 --> 00:57:02.133
Sign on it.

00:57:52.166 --> 00:57:53.566
You don't have to pour an ounce
of liquor for anyone.

00:57:56.400 --> 00:57:58.766
Sixty percent of Veerlapalli's
population are women.

00:57:59.033 --> 00:57:59.733
So what?

00:58:01.133 --> 00:58:02.400
Rajanna, take a look at this.

00:58:04.166 --> 00:58:06.466
To date, no woman has voted
in the elections.

00:58:08.100 --> 00:58:10.233
If we can make them vote for us,

00:58:10.700 --> 00:58:12.633
we don't have to spend
a single penny on liquor.

00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:14.100
Yet we would have
a bumper victory!

00:58:16.466 --> 00:58:20.233
- Long live!
- Brother Shivanna

00:58:24.633 --> 00:58:30.266
I have arranged this urgent
meeting not to announce

00:58:30.600 --> 00:58:32.666
my participation in the elections

00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:36.766
nor to ask you all to vote for me.

00:58:37.600 --> 00:58:40.533
I just want to know why you've never gone
to exercise your voting rights, sisters?

00:58:42.233 --> 00:58:43.466
Why should we vote, Rajanna?

00:58:44.666 --> 00:58:47.133
Can you tell me about a single thing that
the village has gained from the elections?

00:58:50.100 --> 00:58:51.700
Before criticizing me,

00:58:52.600 --> 00:58:55.500
take a good
look at your finger, have you ever voted?

00:58:56.000 --> 00:58:58.466
You have the right to ask questions only
if you have voted.

00:58:59.200 --> 00:59:00.666
Else your words are worthless.

00:59:01.600 --> 00:59:03.300
Don't make us speak, Rajanna.

00:59:03.600 --> 00:59:07.700
We have requested Shivanna multiple times
to move the bar from its original place.

00:59:08.300 --> 00:59:10.700
He responded with a big smile,
but our request was never considered.

00:59:11.133 --> 00:59:13.000
You could not change
the location of the bar,

00:59:13.266 --> 00:59:15.600
how shall we believe
that you can change our fates?

00:59:17.400 --> 00:59:18.666
You are right.

00:59:20.066 --> 00:59:21.133
I agree.

00:59:21.766 --> 00:59:24.366
Now I feel like asking you for your votes.

00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:27.100
Vote for me.

00:59:28.200 --> 00:59:30.200
I promise you to change
the location of the bar.

00:59:30.366 --> 00:59:32.433
Rajanna, think before making promises.

00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:34.466
Don't interfere with the
business of Silk Bar, Rajanna.

00:59:34.533 --> 00:59:36.266
It's a sensitive subject.

00:59:36.533 --> 00:59:39.266
I have faced every possible humiliation
in the past few decades.

00:59:39.666 --> 00:59:41.266
I have nothing to lose.

00:59:41.733 --> 00:59:45.133
If I win, I would make sure
there would be no mother

00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:52.333
in this village who would be searching
for her son at midnight holding a lantern.

00:59:54.266 --> 00:59:57.633
I would make sure,
no woman awaits her husband's arrival

00:59:58.000 --> 00:59:59.100
after sunset with tears in her eyes.

00:59:59.166 --> 01:00:00.500
Will you really move the bar, Rajanna?

01:00:00.566 --> 01:00:01.766
That is in your hands.

01:00:03.333 --> 01:00:04.600
Vote for Rajanna and make him victorious.

01:00:05.333 --> 01:00:08.100
If your work is not done,
grab me by the collar and question me.

01:00:08.633 --> 01:00:12.433
Suri's words made quite an impact
on the ladies.

01:00:12.766 --> 01:00:14.700
In the Veerlapalli Sarpanch Elections,

01:00:14.766 --> 01:00:18.200
Thurpugutta Rajanna, who contested
the elections on the symbol of the earring

01:00:18.266 --> 01:00:20.733
has won against his opponent,
Thurpugutta Chinna Nambaiah,

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:24.266
who contested the elections with the ring
symbol with the bumper majority of votes.

01:00:24.333 --> 01:00:28.266
Similarly, Dharani who won as
a member of the tenth ward has

01:00:28.366 --> 01:00:33.366
won as Deputy Sarpanch with the support
of the rest of the ward members.

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.433
SILK BAR

01:00:36.700 --> 01:00:38.500
The women's respect for Rajanna

01:00:39.033 --> 01:00:42.033
and their trust in Suri's words
made us victorious this time.

01:00:42.300 --> 01:00:44.300
For the first time, alcohol had lost.

01:00:44.466 --> 01:00:46.000
This is a paradigm shift
in Veerlapalli's story.

01:00:52.400 --> 01:00:55.533
There will be no discrimination
in the bar.

01:00:56.200 --> 01:01:00.400
Henceforth every man
in Veerlapalli will be treated equally.

01:01:00.733 --> 01:01:01.666
Come on.

01:01:04.400 --> 01:01:07.466
Long live, Rajanna!

01:01:48.633 --> 01:01:54.600
You are such a lucky guy,
my Suri dear...

01:01:54.733 --> 01:01:56.333
Enough with your overacting!

01:01:56.566 --> 01:01:59.233
Here, have something.
You never know how long it may take.

01:02:00.466 --> 01:02:02.566
Who made such a huge decorative mark?

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.066
That much is necessary,
such is my beauty!

01:02:05.233 --> 01:02:06.566
VENNELA SURYAM

01:03:21.700 --> 01:03:23.000
What are you doing here?

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:25.233
I came here to take a leak.

01:03:27.400 --> 01:03:28.366
Is this urine?

01:03:33.633 --> 01:03:36.200
That's why I asked you
to forget about her.

01:03:40.533 --> 01:03:41.633
I'm unfortunate in this lifetime.

01:03:43.200 --> 01:03:46.266
But Vennela will be my wife
in my next birth, I'm damn sure.

01:03:46.666 --> 01:03:48.233
If Suri loves her again?

01:03:54.200 --> 01:03:55.133
I will sacrifice her again.

01:03:56.433 --> 01:03:58.533
I will sacrifice
Vennela again for him.

01:04:01.233 --> 01:04:02.366
How can I let him suffer?

01:04:07.300 --> 01:04:08.500
He is my friend, bro.

01:04:11.300 --> 01:04:12.233
Hey...

01:04:18.233 --> 01:04:19.200
Hey, let go of me... go!

01:04:19.566 --> 01:04:20.533
Go and play some music...

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:22.733
I'll come and dance

01:04:25.500 --> 01:04:27.133
Look at him, he is crying like a kid.

01:04:27.433 --> 01:04:29.500
I would sacrifice anything
for my friends, bloody...

01:05:47.233 --> 01:05:48.466
Take them in.

01:06:40.566 --> 01:06:42.733
The marriage was a grand event, bro!

01:06:43.600 --> 01:06:44.500
Correct bro.

01:06:44.566 --> 01:06:47.133
Dharani, the curry you made was
out of this world!

01:06:47.700 --> 01:06:51.166
By the way, why are you sober
at your friend's wedding?

01:06:51.266 --> 01:06:52.600
- Take this.
- Have it.

01:07:02.233 --> 01:07:04.166
- Come, let's go.
- Where to go?

01:07:04.233 --> 01:07:05.333
What's happened to him today?

01:07:05.400 --> 01:07:06.366
Get up!

01:07:07.233 --> 01:07:08.166
Let's go.

01:07:17.400 --> 01:07:18.433
Hey, Srinu!

01:07:28.500 --> 01:07:30.566
Why is he here so late at night?

01:07:31.200 --> 01:07:34.200
The marriage just concluded
and you're already at the bar?

01:07:50.633 --> 01:07:54.166
Suri is here,
come on let's go inside, bro.

01:07:54.600 --> 01:07:55.500
Move...

01:08:12.566 --> 01:08:16.133
Bro, weren't all the guests sloshed?
They slept in the function hall, right?

01:08:16.233 --> 01:08:17.366
Then who are these guys?

01:08:19.633 --> 01:08:22.033
Bro, the bar is closed.

01:08:25.366 --> 01:08:27.399
They don't look like locals

01:08:28.033 --> 01:08:30.433
Bro, there are too many of you.

01:08:31.666 --> 01:08:33.333
This much won't suffice for all of you.

01:08:39.300 --> 01:08:40.266
Hey!

01:08:41.500 --> 01:08:43.166
- Hey!
- Hey!

01:09:25.300 --> 01:09:26.233
Hey!

01:10:05.633 --> 01:10:06.766
Run! Run!

01:10:07.633 --> 01:10:08.600
Hey!

01:11:34.133 --> 01:11:35.033
Come on, move...

01:11:36.466 --> 01:11:37.400
Hey!

01:11:43.566 --> 01:11:44.500
Hey!

01:11:45.466 --> 01:11:46.366
Hey!

01:12:08.066 --> 01:12:09.000
Oh god!

01:12:49.500 --> 01:12:51.700
{\an8}VOTE FOR RING SYMBOL

01:13:05.133 --> 01:13:06.066
Hey!

01:14:07.200 --> 01:14:08.366
NAXALS WARNING FOR
DHARANI AND HIS FRIENDS

01:14:20.400 --> 01:14:21.700
Let's go! Get on the bicycle.

01:15:12.700 --> 01:15:13.633
Don't worry.

01:15:14.233 --> 01:15:15.166
You'll be alright.

01:15:18.233 --> 01:15:19.133
I...

01:15:19.300 --> 01:15:20.266
I am here for you.

01:17:59.666 --> 01:18:03.366
Once, you were my childhood friend

01:18:03.433 --> 01:18:08.233
Now, you are my life partner

01:18:14.433 --> 01:18:18.200
Once, you were my childhood friend

01:18:18.266 --> 01:18:22.633
Now, you are my life partner

01:18:29.333 --> 01:18:35.766
Today you leave us in a pool of tears

01:18:36.633 --> 01:18:43.466
Your death leaves us inconsolable

01:19:21.700 --> 01:19:23.466
Who is going to light the pyre?

01:19:49.333 --> 01:19:52.433
My toe-rings

01:19:53.033 --> 01:19:56.266
And the bangles which you put

01:19:56.633 --> 01:20:00.133
On are still intact

01:20:00.200 --> 01:20:03.233
Look, my dear

01:20:04.133 --> 01:20:10.266
The marriage celebrations
Had not fizzled out yet

01:20:11.033 --> 01:20:17.533
And we see death
Dancing at our doorstep

01:20:18.200 --> 01:20:25.000
Which God

01:20:25.600 --> 01:20:31.433
Is to be blamed for my ruined fate?

01:21:06.600 --> 01:21:10.200
Your friends who always accompanied you

01:21:10.333 --> 01:21:14.000
Who dared any extremes for you

01:21:14.133 --> 01:21:20.466
Follow your corpse today

01:21:21.333 --> 01:21:27.633
They didn't leave you alone even in death

01:21:28.233 --> 01:21:35.100
Your childhood friend now becomes
Your companion in the other world

01:21:35.500 --> 01:21:38.700
Don't go away from your people

01:21:39.266 --> 01:21:42.366
From your relatives

01:21:43.066 --> 01:21:48.566
And your faction

01:22:20.333 --> 01:22:23.533
Wake up

01:22:24.133 --> 01:22:25.433
Wake up

01:22:27.700 --> 01:22:32.666
Wake up, please wake up

01:22:36.600 --> 01:22:40.766
Once, you were my childhood friend

01:22:41.200 --> 01:22:47.500
Your death leaves us inconsolable

01:23:01.433 --> 01:23:02.600
- Have you gone mad?
- Hey!

01:23:02.666 --> 01:23:04.100
See how you're bleeding.

01:23:14.533 --> 01:23:16.233
I got scared, Suri.

01:23:19.733 --> 01:23:24.233
You know everything
about me except this.

01:23:27.100 --> 01:23:28.033
Vennela.

01:23:31.066 --> 01:23:33.733
I was scared you'd leave her as I did...

01:23:36.600 --> 01:23:40.733
if you got to know that I loved her.

01:23:46.766 --> 01:23:48.066
I have no idea...

01:23:50.300 --> 01:23:55.033
how heartbroken you were when you learned
about it.

01:23:58.733 --> 01:24:00.100
Forgive me.

01:24:04.133 --> 01:24:06.600
Get back to me at least once.

01:24:08.366 --> 01:24:10.633
I want to drink alcohol with you.

01:24:18.200 --> 01:24:20.033
Except for these posters,

01:24:20.766 --> 01:24:23.100
we didn't find any weapons
or any other evidence.

01:24:29.433 --> 01:24:32.100
Those guys should say it now.

01:24:37.200 --> 01:24:38.233
Then ask them.

01:24:38.633 --> 01:24:39.666
They destroyed the village,

01:24:40.333 --> 01:24:42.033
and now they are sleeping.

01:24:42.666 --> 01:24:43.700
Now who should be held responsible
for the village's situation?

01:24:44.400 --> 01:24:46.733
If they really put up posters
and killed people

01:24:47.566 --> 01:24:48.466
then they would kill with guns.

01:24:48.533 --> 01:24:51.066
Have you ever seen
them chasing anyone like this?

01:24:51.533 --> 01:24:53.000
That is true.

01:24:54.300 --> 01:24:56.333
Think at least once.

01:24:58.566 --> 01:25:00.066
What did we do, Rajanna?

01:25:00.566 --> 01:25:03.733
Why would they want to chase and kill us?

01:25:08.566 --> 01:25:10.400
Even what you said is true, Dharani.

01:25:13.166 --> 01:25:15.300
They would kill with guns,

01:25:16.700 --> 01:25:18.133
why would they kill anyone
by chasing them?

01:25:19.533 --> 01:25:21.400
Okay. Forget about that.

01:25:26.033 --> 01:25:28.066
What is this bruise on your head?

01:25:29.066 --> 01:25:30.733
He fell from a bicycle.

01:25:32.200 --> 01:25:33.400
Brother!

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:35.200
Tell the truth.

01:25:35.566 --> 01:25:37.266
He injured his head
when he hit it with a bottle.

01:25:39.266 --> 01:25:40.200
This is it!

01:25:40.566 --> 01:25:43.500
He doesn't remember
that he hit his own head last night.

01:25:44.100 --> 01:25:46.400
How can he remember
what he did when he was drunk?

01:25:47.700 --> 01:25:49.700
It's not a mistake to forget
what you did when you were drunk.

01:25:51.666 --> 01:25:54.433
It's a mistake to forget
what kind of a mistake you've made then.

01:25:55.633 --> 01:25:57.533
He beat up the police when he was drunk.

01:25:58.700 --> 01:26:00.266
He broke everything at the bar.

01:26:01.100 --> 01:26:03.033
He went to people's houses
and created a mess.

01:26:04.066 --> 01:26:06.266
Let's forget all about these things.

01:26:08.600 --> 01:26:09.600
But now...

01:26:10.733 --> 01:26:16.100
he has forgotten about
a big mistake he made.

01:26:17.466 --> 01:26:18.566
What's wrong?

01:26:19.200 --> 01:26:22.266
Four men and one woman's life.

01:26:23.533 --> 01:26:25.366
But the thing is...

01:26:27.166 --> 01:26:31.000
he doesn't even remember
that his friend also died because of him.

01:26:41.366 --> 01:26:43.533
Even now, he's here with a drink.

01:26:45.500 --> 01:26:47.633
Now should we go to the village council
because of him?

01:26:48.300 --> 01:26:49.666
And he's the head?

01:26:51.066 --> 01:26:52.766
And we're here,
setting aside all its work.

01:26:54.133 --> 01:26:55.066
Let's go.

01:27:02.066 --> 01:27:03.000
Hey...

01:27:03.666 --> 01:27:06.133
don't leave him alone
when he is drunk.

01:27:07.300 --> 01:27:08.366
Take care of him.

01:27:20.500 --> 01:27:23.466
He doesn't remember that
he hit his own head last night.

01:27:27.266 --> 01:27:29.500
How can he remember
what he did when he was drunk?

01:27:31.700 --> 01:27:37.200
Now he has forgotten about
a big mistake he made.

01:27:40.533 --> 01:27:42.400
But the thing is,

01:27:43.566 --> 01:27:47.366
he doesn't even remember
that his friend also died because of him.

01:27:49.366 --> 01:27:52.500
Four men and one woman's life.

01:27:58.600 --> 01:27:59.500
Hey...

01:28:00.233 --> 01:28:02.600
don't leave him alone
when he is drunk.

01:28:03.600 --> 01:28:04.733
Take care of him.

01:28:33.033 --> 01:28:35.333
This is the village where we
grew up, can't I roam in this village

01:28:36.066 --> 01:28:37.200
at night without being intoxicated?

01:30:17.700 --> 01:30:19.433
TURPUGUTTA CHINNA NAMBAIAH

01:30:21.700 --> 01:30:28.600
{\an8}TURPUGUTTA CHINNA NAMBAIAH

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:07.400
Hey, Nambi!

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:28.766
Nambi!

01:31:29.200 --> 01:31:30.100
Come out!

01:31:30.166 --> 01:31:31.066
Dharani.

01:31:31.433 --> 01:31:32.566
Where is your husband?

01:31:41.466 --> 01:31:42.400
What happened?

01:31:47.066 --> 01:31:48.066
We won the cricket match.

01:31:48.266 --> 01:31:50.500
We broke everything at the bar.
We made Rajanna win.

01:31:50.633 --> 01:31:51.766
Why did he kill them all just for that?

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:54.666
Nambi! Come out!

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:01.766
Mark my words.

01:32:02.600 --> 01:32:04.400
Today will be the day
of your husband's death.

01:32:06.400 --> 01:32:07.400
Death.

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:09.766
Nambi!

01:32:12.333 --> 01:32:15.233
You bloody... Nambi...

01:32:15.433 --> 01:32:17.766
My husband is not in the village.
He will arrive tomorrow morning.

01:32:23.466 --> 01:32:24.633
Let that scoundrel come.

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:27.266
When he gets here,
I'll kill him immediately.

01:32:35.300 --> 01:32:37.433
You made him win the cricket match.

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:39.666
You beat up Sai at the bar.

01:32:40.266 --> 01:32:42.066
You triumphed to be the Deputy Sarpanch.

01:32:42.466 --> 01:32:44.133
You did all these things,

01:32:44.566 --> 01:32:46.466
then why did he kill your friends?

01:32:52.066 --> 01:32:53.033
For Vennela.

01:32:58.133 --> 01:33:00.033
He killed Suri for Vennela.

01:33:13.433 --> 01:33:14.633
He lusts after her.

01:33:22.566 --> 01:33:24.000
His lust is at such peaks

01:33:24.433 --> 01:33:27.000
that he will burn the whole tree for
a single leaf that obstructs his view.

01:33:34.100 --> 01:33:37.500
My husband knows how
many saris she has and in what colors.

01:33:39.033 --> 01:33:40.733
While looking at her from this window,

01:33:41.466 --> 01:33:43.066
he used to put his hands on me.

01:33:49.666 --> 01:33:55.500
His lust was so intense that he used
to go and smell her when she was out.

01:34:15.200 --> 01:34:18.200
The anger that you are feeling now
because he killed your friends,

01:34:18.700 --> 01:34:20.333
is equal to the anger that he feels

01:34:20.400 --> 01:34:22.233
when he doesn't get to sleep
with the woman he likes.

01:34:25.300 --> 01:34:29.266
He killed Suri the other day
in only one shot.

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:49.300
He killed the others so
that no one would suspect him.

01:34:50.133 --> 01:34:52.166
He once killed Padma's husband as well.

01:34:53.333 --> 01:34:55.266
You are challenging a guy like him.

01:34:58.300 --> 01:34:59.666
Now, that naive girl's life

01:35:00.200 --> 01:35:02.633
is more important than your vengeance.

01:35:04.266 --> 01:35:05.233
If possible,

01:35:08.133 --> 01:35:10.000
see that Vennela
won't end up like Padma.

01:35:11.766 --> 01:35:14.400
It depends on you if you can hide
her or make her leave this village.

01:35:14.633 --> 01:35:16.233
Come play with the sword after that.

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:19.300
Then I'll accept you as a man,
no matter whether you kill him or die.

01:35:24.066 --> 01:35:27.433
But you have to do it
before tomorrow's ritual.

01:36:26.600 --> 01:36:28.766
Suri's soul is still restless,

01:36:29.400 --> 01:36:31.266
that's why no bird has
yet touched the food.

01:36:51.133 --> 01:36:53.000
It seems like you paid a visit
to my house yesterday.

01:36:55.700 --> 01:36:57.166
My wife told me everything.

01:36:58.766 --> 01:37:02.366
If you want to take her away
from this village, as she said,

01:37:03.400 --> 01:37:04.433
then erase those thoughts now.

01:37:06.733 --> 01:37:08.066
Brother!

01:37:09.733 --> 01:37:12.100
I'll take her away,
sooner rather than later.

01:37:14.066 --> 01:37:18.766
Only my hands should touch her body.

01:37:20.366 --> 01:37:21.433
Got it?

01:37:29.333 --> 01:37:30.233
What happened?

01:37:30.300 --> 01:37:31.733
Get the vehicle to Vennela's house.

01:37:40.133 --> 01:37:46.166
Cute doll and the beloved doll of Siva

01:37:48.166 --> 01:37:53.766
Where are those smiles
Of the cute baby now?

01:37:57.033 --> 01:38:03.033
When the lady is given a divine head bath

01:38:04.500 --> 01:38:09.766
Lord Rama hasn't come down here

01:38:12.533 --> 01:38:18.500
When she was being made a widow

01:38:20.700 --> 01:38:26.433
Where did Lord Krishna vanish?

01:38:29.333 --> 01:38:35.600
When her pearl bangles were being broken

01:38:37.400 --> 01:38:43.066
Where did Lord Venkatesha go away?

01:38:45.400 --> 01:38:51.233
When the nocturnal thread
Was being removed

01:38:53.300 --> 01:38:58.700
Where did Lord Paramesha disappear?

01:39:01.500 --> 01:39:07.066
No Lord has come down here

01:39:09.266 --> 01:39:12.033
No Lord has come down here

01:39:12.100 --> 01:39:13.033
Vehicle ready.

01:39:13.100 --> 01:39:14.766
No Lord has come down here

01:39:35.266 --> 01:39:36.533
Why have you come here again?

01:39:36.733 --> 01:39:38.333
Did you come here earlier
to make her a widow?

01:39:38.533 --> 01:39:41.233
You said that he's your friend
and married her off

01:39:41.300 --> 01:39:43.033
to a person who was going to die
and made her life miserable.

01:39:43.133 --> 01:39:44.766
What else is left
to do now for you here?

01:39:46.033 --> 01:39:49.733
It's been ten days,
she hasn't said anything.

01:39:50.266 --> 01:39:52.500
She won't listen to our words either.

01:39:52.733 --> 01:39:55.433
Is he not the reason behind all this?
Tell me!

01:40:52.100 --> 01:40:54.266
You're making her wear a nuptial chain
when she's just become a widow?

01:40:55.066 --> 01:40:57.433
Do you have the courage
to marry our family's girl?

01:40:57.733 --> 01:40:59.166
You scoundrels.

01:40:59.433 --> 01:41:01.166
Shut up, you scoundrels!

01:41:01.300 --> 01:41:02.466
Why are you talking about caste?

01:41:02.700 --> 01:41:07.100
For the last ten days, no one looked at us
to see whether we were alive or dead.

01:41:07.766 --> 01:41:10.133
Mind your tongue!

01:41:10.366 --> 01:41:13.200
I'm asking this to protect
the honor of our caste!

01:41:13.500 --> 01:41:16.500
I don't care about caste
if she's getting a way to lead her life.

01:41:17.200 --> 01:41:19.733
Why should you bother when their
own family doesn't have any problems?

01:41:21.666 --> 01:41:22.600
Dharani,

01:41:23.533 --> 01:41:24.500
take her with you.

01:42:04.400 --> 01:42:05.300
The food...

01:42:46.733 --> 01:42:49.000
You're not aware
of what you've done.

01:42:50.033 --> 01:42:52.100
Your help will lead to his death now.

01:42:54.133 --> 01:43:01.033
I'm going to cut off everyone's necks
this Dasara.

01:43:02.366 --> 01:43:05.233
He's not Lord Rama,

01:43:06.133 --> 01:43:07.600
and she isn't Sita to escape.

01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:10.633
However, I certainly am Ravana.

01:43:12.133 --> 01:43:13.133
Got it?

01:44:39.466 --> 01:44:41.233
His head should fall off
in one fell swoop.

01:44:42.066 --> 01:44:43.633
If we kill him now, then we
won't get to know who chased us.

01:44:45.600 --> 01:44:47.300
And he doesn't come off so easily.

01:44:50.700 --> 01:44:53.500
We should do something
that he comes out all by himself.

01:44:55.100 --> 01:44:56.066
Bloody hell!

01:44:57.600 --> 01:44:59.066
Let's do it at the right time.

01:45:01.566 --> 01:45:04.666
Let's kill them altogether.

01:45:37.133 --> 01:45:39.100
- Teacher.
- Teacher.

01:45:45.300 --> 01:45:46.666
For how many days will you be like this?

01:45:47.066 --> 01:45:49.400
Students have been asking me
about you every day.

01:45:49.566 --> 01:45:50.700
That's why I brought them here.

01:45:51.300 --> 01:45:53.066
Yes, Teacher Vennela.

01:45:53.233 --> 01:45:56.566
I brought you mutton too.

01:46:16.300 --> 01:46:17.500
So this is the time for you to come out?

01:46:19.700 --> 01:46:21.766
Seems to me
that you haven't experienced anything yet.

01:46:22.033 --> 01:46:22.733
Hey, Saida!

01:46:23.166 --> 01:46:24.100
Hey!

01:46:27.366 --> 01:46:28.733
Dharani is just a waste.

01:46:29.333 --> 01:46:31.533
He doesn't even dare
to do anything unless he's drunk.

01:46:32.033 --> 01:46:33.233
Then what can he do for you?

01:46:34.300 --> 01:46:36.200
However, marriage is not your thing.

01:46:37.433 --> 01:46:39.000
Shall I tell you one thing?

01:46:39.366 --> 01:46:41.166
If you get married,
then you have only one husband.

01:46:41.600 --> 01:46:43.366
But if you're a widow, then...

01:46:46.500 --> 01:46:48.700
Padma, tell her more.

01:48:51.100 --> 01:48:53.700
If you ever trouble my wife again,

01:48:54.066 --> 01:48:55.300
beware!

01:48:56.200 --> 01:48:58.500
I'll pluck out your...

01:49:03.733 --> 01:49:05.100
I don't care about the consequences...

01:49:06.500 --> 01:49:07.400
let's see.

01:49:48.600 --> 01:49:50.266
Whose permission did you take to marry me?

01:49:54.333 --> 01:49:56.433
Is it the right thing to do?

01:49:57.166 --> 01:49:58.300
To marry a girl without her consent?

01:50:00.300 --> 01:50:01.533
All the people of this village think

01:50:03.300 --> 01:50:05.066
that I'll go

01:50:06.033 --> 01:50:08.300
and marry anyone.

01:50:12.500 --> 01:50:14.100
They don't know

01:50:15.066 --> 01:50:18.300
that your armlet has made me helpless.

01:50:21.133 --> 01:50:24.766
I didn't even realize that I was
in your house till dawn.

01:50:27.633 --> 01:50:29.366
Am I a toy from the market?

01:50:35.066 --> 01:50:39.366
I don't know where to go or what to do.

01:50:42.300 --> 01:50:44.266
Everything is happening
because of you.

01:50:47.033 --> 01:50:50.166
I'm getting angry and I want
to kill you when I see you.

01:50:54.233 --> 01:50:56.200
But I don't have any strength left in me.

01:51:01.633 --> 01:51:03.566
Why did you marry me?

01:51:07.233 --> 01:51:08.566
You are my friend, Vennela.

01:51:12.533 --> 01:51:14.733
I've seen you wearing beautiful clothes
and jewelry ever since we were children.

01:51:15.633 --> 01:51:16.666
When I came back,

01:51:17.366 --> 01:51:19.733
I saw people breaking your bangles
and removing the bindi on your face.

01:51:21.200 --> 01:51:22.266
I couldn't endure that.

01:51:25.633 --> 01:51:26.533
I was scared that

01:51:28.500 --> 01:51:31.066
maybe they'd take away your smile too.

01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:34.266
That's why I married you.

01:51:36.666 --> 01:51:38.200
It was my mistake
to marry you without asking you.

01:51:39.066 --> 01:51:41.033
I didn't know what to do at that time.

01:51:45.366 --> 01:51:46.300
Forgive me.

01:52:07.033 --> 01:52:08.166
I want to say one thing to you.

01:52:09.533 --> 01:52:12.533
Loan sharks came
to my house after my husband's death.

01:52:14.366 --> 01:52:15.766
I didn't know what to do.

01:52:17.066 --> 01:52:18.733
Chinna Nambi paid off my debts

01:52:20.566 --> 01:52:22.266
and then exploited me physically.

01:52:24.766 --> 01:52:26.733
So I surrendered to him
for the sake of my children.

01:52:28.633 --> 01:52:30.433
People say that a woman is like
the Lord Bathukamma.

01:52:31.566 --> 01:52:34.466
But they don't let widows celebrate
the Bathukamma festival.

01:52:35.366 --> 01:52:39.100
Dharani made your life easier than mine.

01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:48.766
Even though he married you,
he called you a friend.

01:52:49.566 --> 01:52:51.600
Where will you get a good
husband other than him?

01:52:52.466 --> 01:52:54.266
If you don't want to treat him
like a husband,

01:52:55.033 --> 01:52:57.200
treat him like a childhood friend.

01:54:05.333 --> 01:54:07.000
{\an8}HAPPY NEW YEAR, VENNELA
DHARANI

01:54:40.566 --> 01:54:41.500
What is this?

01:54:43.333 --> 01:54:45.333
What do you want to do
with these weapons?

01:54:48.366 --> 01:54:49.266
I'm asking you!

01:54:50.300 --> 01:54:53.166
Why don't you answer me?

01:54:55.500 --> 01:54:58.166
We've collected these to kill
the people who killed my friends.

01:54:59.066 --> 01:54:59.766
Don't shout at me now!

01:55:00.466 --> 01:55:02.233
You've been a coward all along,

01:55:02.300 --> 01:55:04.200
but now you have animosity with Nambi.

01:55:04.266 --> 01:55:05.633
My limbs tremble at the
thought of its aftermath.

01:55:07.200 --> 01:55:10.266
Are you aware of the path you are taking
with these weapons you have collected?

01:55:12.166 --> 01:55:13.533
Yes, we are aware of that.

01:55:14.733 --> 01:55:15.733
What will happen?

01:55:16.533 --> 01:55:17.500
We'll die. That's it.

01:55:18.466 --> 01:55:20.300
Then take our dead bodies
and dig a grave beside my friends' graves.

01:55:20.366 --> 01:55:21.466
What are you saying?

01:55:32.433 --> 01:55:35.200
Suri didn't leave my hand before he died.

01:55:37.500 --> 01:55:41.366
I used to be so scared,
but he gave me the courage.

01:55:47.600 --> 01:55:50.300
Now I can't live like this,
knowing that he is no more.

01:55:53.533 --> 01:55:55.400
If it would've been him, dammit!

01:55:56.366 --> 01:55:57.400
He would've killed them by now.

01:55:58.733 --> 01:56:00.166
He wouldn't wait this long like me.

01:56:03.733 --> 01:56:07.400
Do you know how hurtful it is to watch
a close friend die in front of your eyes?

01:56:10.333 --> 01:56:11.433
No matter what you say,

01:56:12.100 --> 01:56:13.166
if not now,

01:56:15.166 --> 01:56:16.366
I'll kill them tomorrow.

01:56:24.433 --> 01:56:26.500
Then why did you bring her along?

01:56:27.300 --> 01:56:29.633
If she becomes a widow again,
do you want her to live like me?

01:56:32.666 --> 01:56:33.666
Look at me.

01:56:35.666 --> 01:56:37.300
Even Suri, who died,

01:56:38.333 --> 01:56:40.100
would wish for a long life for you.

01:56:40.733 --> 01:56:43.166
On the other hand,
you want to die for them!

01:56:47.133 --> 01:56:49.366
We should be the ones to die in your hands

01:56:51.533 --> 01:56:53.533
not the other way around.

01:56:55.466 --> 01:56:59.766
I can't watch more people dying.

01:57:04.033 --> 01:57:05.233
I can't.

01:57:06.133 --> 01:57:08.400
Drop those weapons here.

01:57:11.433 --> 01:57:14.033
I beg your pardon, please.

01:58:08.266 --> 01:58:10.100
Your friends won't go far away from you.

01:58:10.700 --> 01:58:14.466
Like the sun that goes
away and comes at dawn,

01:58:15.433 --> 01:58:18.500
they'll come to you in
the form of your kids.

01:58:25.033 --> 01:58:26.700
- When is the wedding?
- The day after tomorrow.

01:58:30.633 --> 01:58:33.000
- Is Dharani here?
- Yes. He is here, uncle.

01:58:33.100 --> 01:58:34.466
- Come.
- Dharani.

01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:36.300
Inzamam's father is here

01:58:38.066 --> 01:58:39.333
Why are you here suddenly?

01:58:39.466 --> 01:58:41.666
My daughter's marriage is approaching.

01:58:42.266 --> 01:58:43.566
So I'm here to invite you.

01:58:44.333 --> 01:58:45.733
Why all these formalities? We'll come.

01:58:46.133 --> 01:58:47.700
You used to come when your friend was here

01:58:48.100 --> 01:58:49.200
but now everything has changed.

01:58:50.500 --> 01:58:51.433
Okay. We'll leave.

01:58:52.266 --> 01:58:53.200
Please come to the wedding.

01:58:53.266 --> 01:58:54.433
- Sure.
- Bye, sister.

01:58:57.033 --> 01:58:57.733
Hey,

01:58:58.000 --> 01:58:59.266
let's make this wedding a big celebration.

01:59:33.133 --> 01:59:35.266
MARRIAGE

01:59:43.200 --> 01:59:48.233
Hey, sister-in-law, he looks
Dashing in a dazzling shirt

01:59:48.300 --> 01:59:53.000
He winked at me wearing goggles

01:59:53.300 --> 01:59:57.433
Hey, sister-in-law, he used to sit
At home wearing a tattered shirt

01:59:57.500 --> 02:00:03.066
Hey, sister-in-law, he lies
On the bed in a shabby lungi

02:00:03.133 --> 02:00:06.333
I sprayed perfume in
The days when we were newly married

02:00:08.200 --> 02:00:11.666
I was right behind you all the time

02:00:13.466 --> 02:00:16.033
I was kissing you and getting flowers

02:00:16.100 --> 02:00:18.466
Your talks were so sweet as sugar

02:00:18.533 --> 02:00:23.233
You changed and your voice is loud now
I got addicted to liquor

02:00:23.566 --> 02:00:27.700
Hey, sister-in-law, after getting drunk
He beats me up badly

02:00:27.766 --> 02:00:30.300
Just once in a while half-heartedly

02:00:30.366 --> 02:00:33.566
He makes loves for his needs

02:00:36.233 --> 02:00:38.700
Man in dazzling shirt

02:00:40.766 --> 02:00:43.700
Never brings me any gift

02:00:44.366 --> 02:00:48.700
Hey God!

02:00:49.300 --> 02:00:53.466
Hey God!

02:00:53.533 --> 02:00:56.400
He came in like a thief while
I was in the kitchen

02:00:56.466 --> 02:00:58.300
He was pinching at my waist

02:00:58.533 --> 02:01:01.433
Now he always is pointing out my mistakes

02:01:01.500 --> 02:01:03.566
He says not to overreact

02:01:03.633 --> 02:01:06.466
I took such great care
Of you like a baby

02:01:06.533 --> 02:01:08.533
Didn't I always console you?

02:01:08.700 --> 02:01:11.566
You always overreact everywhere

02:01:11.633 --> 02:01:13.466
Aren't you ruining my prestige
In the streets?

02:01:13.733 --> 02:01:18.766
What's wrong with him and
What has possessed him?

02:01:19.233 --> 02:01:21.566
Maybe I got old, I can't bear it anymore

02:01:21.633 --> 02:01:24.700
He's ruining my image
In public in return now

02:01:25.633 --> 02:01:30.700
Hey, sister-in-law, he looks
Dashing in a dazzling shirt

02:01:30.766 --> 02:01:35.466
He winked at me wearing goggles

02:01:35.700 --> 02:01:38.333
Hey, brother-in-law
She never asks anything openly

02:01:38.400 --> 02:01:41.000
Hey, brother-in-law
She never does what I said

02:01:41.066 --> 02:01:42.466
She always sits in the neighbor's house

02:01:42.533 --> 02:01:45.566
And keeps complaining about me

02:01:45.766 --> 02:01:48.366
Hey, brother-in-law
She says she was harmed

02:01:48.433 --> 02:01:51.000
Hey, brother-in-law
She always is into weeping

02:01:51.066 --> 02:01:52.600
Your sister, when I try to begin some chat

02:01:52.666 --> 02:01:55.533
She always is into over criticizing me

02:01:56.033 --> 02:01:58.500
Either in dark or at the front door

02:01:58.566 --> 02:02:01.133
A husband protects like the eyelids

02:02:01.200 --> 02:02:03.533
Even in any mess when you are with him

02:02:03.600 --> 02:02:06.166
He stands opposing
And wins over the hurdles

02:02:06.233 --> 02:02:07.700
Even when in any great troubles

02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:10.733
He keeps you safe in his heart

02:02:11.200 --> 02:02:12.733
Your bindi and your bangles

02:02:13.000 --> 02:02:16.000
Are his valuable life forever

02:02:28.066 --> 02:02:30.200
I made mistakes in life due to politics,

02:02:31.366 --> 02:02:32.566
but never have I committed sins!

02:02:34.033 --> 02:02:37.666
It's despicable enough that you crave
another woman while being married.

02:02:38.066 --> 02:02:40.733
But you've stooped further
by killing people for her.

02:02:42.400 --> 02:02:47.000
A ten-headed demon died at the hands of
a single-headed king because of a woman.

02:02:47.233 --> 02:02:49.166
Are our lives
greater than myths?

02:02:50.733 --> 02:02:52.666
I made a mistake by giving birth to you.

02:04:13.566 --> 02:04:14.500
Dharani!

02:04:17.100 --> 02:04:18.766
Have you ever loved someone?

02:04:25.266 --> 02:04:27.000
Oh my God!

02:04:28.233 --> 02:04:29.400
Who is that girl?

02:04:36.466 --> 02:04:40.366
I was a child when I first saw her
on this street at the Bathukamma festival.

02:04:42.200 --> 02:04:46.233
You know how beautiful she was
when she wore her

02:04:47.400 --> 02:04:52.466
short plait from back to front,

02:04:54.766 --> 02:04:57.466
accompanied by the sound her anklets made
as she walked by slowly.

02:05:00.166 --> 02:05:04.266
It was as if Goddess Gauri was
carrying Goddess Bathukamma in her hands.

02:05:07.100 --> 02:05:09.300
I thought she was the one for me.

02:05:12.566 --> 02:05:14.233
Did you confess your love to her?

02:05:21.333 --> 02:05:22.333
I was scared.

02:05:24.366 --> 02:05:26.400
After that, she fell in love with
another guy.

02:05:28.566 --> 02:05:30.100
She's married as well.

02:05:33.100 --> 02:05:34.400
Oh! She's married?

02:05:38.166 --> 02:05:40.066
Have you ever thought of her?

02:05:43.133 --> 02:05:45.666
It's been 15 Dasara festivals
since I last saw her.

02:05:48.300 --> 02:05:50.300
But I'm stuck there.

02:06:04.133 --> 02:06:05.100
Hold tight

02:06:05.166 --> 02:06:06.233
DASARA CELEBRATIONS
VEERLAPALLI

02:06:09.100 --> 02:06:10.033
It's done! Let's move there...

02:06:17.433 --> 02:06:21.733
Hail Lord Rama!

02:06:57.666 --> 02:06:58.633
Vennela.

02:07:48.433 --> 02:07:50.033
SIDDHAM SURIYA

02:08:31.333 --> 02:08:34.166
Which do you believe is greater,
love or lust?

02:08:36.033 --> 02:08:36.766
I'm asking you.

02:08:41.333 --> 02:08:45.500
Which do you believe is greater,
love or lust?

02:08:47.200 --> 02:08:49.266
Lust is greater.

02:08:51.400 --> 02:08:58.066
Do you know how beautiful you were in
that white sari the day Suri died

02:08:58.333 --> 02:09:03.766
and you were crying over his dead body?

02:09:05.200 --> 02:09:06.566
Even when you were crying

02:09:07.700 --> 02:09:09.366
you looked so beautiful.

02:09:13.100 --> 02:09:14.366
Dammit!

02:09:15.333 --> 02:09:18.200
I'm the one who killed Suri.

02:09:24.766 --> 02:09:26.466
How can you get scared just by this?

02:09:27.466 --> 02:09:29.166
I killed him for you.

02:09:31.100 --> 02:09:33.633
Suri married you
because he had no idea that if he did,

02:09:34.166 --> 02:09:36.366
he would be dead.

02:09:38.100 --> 02:09:39.700
That's why I killed him.

02:09:46.000 --> 02:09:48.200
I thought you'd be mine if he died

02:09:49.600 --> 02:09:53.700
and I waited for ten days.

02:09:55.066 --> 02:09:58.666
But Dharani entered and married you.

02:09:59.066 --> 02:10:00.466
Scoundrel!

02:10:02.633 --> 02:10:06.566
He married you even though he was aware

02:10:08.666 --> 02:10:11.166
that I would kill anyone who did so.

02:10:12.266 --> 02:10:14.500
Just to save you from me.

02:10:18.633 --> 02:10:21.166
But I'm scared of one thing.

02:10:22.466 --> 02:10:25.066
The love Dharani has for you.

02:10:30.000 --> 02:10:30.700
Yes.

02:10:36.033 --> 02:10:40.133
It was as if Goddess Gauri was
carrying Goddess Bathukamma in her hands.

02:10:40.633 --> 02:10:43.066
I thought she was the one for me.

02:10:49.033 --> 02:10:52.400
Dharani's love for you scares me.

02:10:53.166 --> 02:10:55.566
Even though he sacrificed his love
for Suri,

02:10:56.100 --> 02:10:58.400
his love for you has brought you together.

02:10:59.166 --> 02:11:00.500
Now I'm scared,

02:11:00.566 --> 02:11:06.266
what if his little moment of love,
is greater than 12 years of my lust?

02:11:09.200 --> 02:11:12.400
That's why I'll kill Dharani today.

02:11:27.700 --> 02:11:28.600
Here you go.

02:11:29.133 --> 02:11:30.400
You don't have a sari
in this particular color.

02:11:31.733 --> 02:11:35.766
On Dharani's 11th day after his death,
wear this sari and be ready.

02:11:38.733 --> 02:11:41.233
You belong to me.

02:12:05.566 --> 02:12:11.666
Hail Lord Rama!

02:12:17.000 --> 02:12:22.500
Hail Lord Rama!

02:12:34.233 --> 02:12:40.166
Hail Lord Rama!

02:13:05.233 --> 02:13:11.200
Hail Lord Rama!

02:13:16.066 --> 02:13:17.433
DASARA CELEBRATIONS

02:13:22.466 --> 02:13:23.433
Hey!

02:13:32.133 --> 02:13:35.066
Hail Lord Rama!

02:13:42.666 --> 02:13:44.000
Dharani!

02:14:01.200 --> 02:14:03.066
Dharani!

02:15:20.300 --> 02:15:23.133
This Dasara won't be like last year.

02:15:23.566 --> 02:15:25.166
Bloody hell!

02:15:30.500 --> 02:15:32.733
I promise you...

02:15:34.266 --> 02:15:35.733
what happens will happen eventually.

02:15:36.766 --> 02:15:37.733
Let's see.

02:15:39.733 --> 02:15:40.633
Dharani!

02:18:52.133 --> 02:18:53.133
Dharani!

02:18:54.500 --> 02:18:56.100
What's happening here?

02:18:59.633 --> 02:19:03.299
Nambi is the one who killed my friend.

02:19:10.466 --> 02:19:12.133
You...

02:20:25.433 --> 02:20:32.400
The memories that are engraved

02:20:38.100 --> 02:20:45.066
In the heart forever

02:20:53.466 --> 02:20:54.466
Bury them.

02:23:02.666 --> 02:23:03.766
Bloody hell!

02:24:02.266 --> 02:24:03.333
Hey!

02:24:04.300 --> 02:24:06.600
Hey!

02:24:07.633 --> 02:24:08.766
Hey!

02:24:09.366 --> 02:24:11.100
Please let me go, sir.

02:24:12.266 --> 02:24:14.233
I will kill him and come with you

02:24:15.533 --> 02:24:17.333
I beg of you, sir.

02:24:17.466 --> 02:24:19.533
I will kill him and come with you

02:24:47.700 --> 02:24:48.600
DHARANI

02:24:54.533 --> 02:24:55.700
- Hey!
- Hey!

02:25:26.366 --> 02:25:29.300
DHARANI

02:27:08.466 --> 02:27:12.700
{\an8}AFTER 7 DASARA FESTIVALS

02:27:16.166 --> 02:27:19.533
WELCOME

02:27:42.266 --> 02:27:44.666
She went to Narayana's home
to help a pregnant woman.

02:27:50.033 --> 02:27:51.500
You've given birth to a girl.

02:28:09.400 --> 02:28:10.600
How are you, dear?

02:28:17.400 --> 02:28:18.433
What's wrong with you, sister?

02:28:18.766 --> 02:28:21.400
My husband became a drunkard and died.

02:28:22.533 --> 02:28:26.466
Suri's words about holding one's collar
for his unjustness are gone with him.

02:28:27.666 --> 02:28:30.566
It would've been better
if God had given me some beauty.

02:28:30.733 --> 02:28:34.133
I would've prostituted
for the sake of my children.

02:28:34.200 --> 02:28:35.466
SILK BAR

02:28:35.566 --> 02:28:39.600
How many women in
this village have smiles on their faces?

02:28:42.333 --> 02:28:43.600
Our lives are like this.

02:28:49.733 --> 02:28:51.333
I thought that the village had changed,

02:28:52.266 --> 02:28:53.300
but it hadn't.

02:28:53.366 --> 02:28:55.066
Who are you to burn the bar?

02:28:55.766 --> 02:28:57.400
Hey, Dharani!

02:28:57.466 --> 02:28:59.100
Only the ones who haven't lost
their family members

02:28:59.166 --> 02:29:00.766
to drinking can step forward.

02:29:01.466 --> 02:29:05.066
If anyone else tries to put this fire out...

02:29:07.533 --> 02:29:10.266
I had assumed we had
more female voters...

02:29:11.066 --> 02:29:12.500
because the male birth rate
was low in this village.

02:29:16.466 --> 02:29:19.266
I didn't know that it was because
all women were becoming widows.

02:29:22.300 --> 02:29:23.400
Bloody hell!

02:29:25.566 --> 02:29:27.100
Shame on us all!
