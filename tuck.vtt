00:01:14.825 --> 00:01:18.912
[motorcycle approaching]

00:01:24.835 --> 00:01:27.337
Don't do this, Brother.
We discussed that we'd divide our shares.

00:01:27.921 --> 00:01:30.299
I will give you ten stalks of bananas.
Keep calm and switch on the torch.

00:01:32.092 --> 00:01:33.302
How dare he warns me to keep
my hands off these bananas!

00:01:33.385 --> 00:01:34.011
Don't do this, Brother.

00:01:34.094 --> 00:01:35.679
If our little brother comes to know
about it, there'd be a big brawl.

00:01:35.804 --> 00:01:37.764
If our mother was alive, she'd have
registered this farm in my name.

00:01:37.806 --> 00:01:38.557
Brother, don't do this.

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.642
See, I've told you that
your elder brother would come.

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:42.394
Brother...

00:01:42.978 --> 00:01:45.314
Did he become a big guy to
summon me to the village council?

00:01:45.397 --> 00:01:47.524
Please listen to me, Brother.
Don't do this, Brother.

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:49.234
Hey!

00:01:50.027 --> 00:01:50.861
[gasps] Hey!

00:01:51.695 --> 00:01:52.529
Brother...

00:01:53.071 --> 00:01:54.406
-Bloody vixen!-Brother...

00:01:54.448 --> 00:01:55.157
Hack him!

00:01:55.199 --> 00:01:56.408
Don't do this, Brother.
Let's sit and talk.

00:01:58.911 --> 00:02:00.954
Didn't I ask you to stay away from
these bananas, till we resolve.

00:02:01.121 --> 00:02:01.997
Didn't I?

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:03.123
-Don't spare him!
-Didn't I tell you?

00:02:03.457 --> 00:02:04.583
-Stop there!
-Hey!

00:02:10.631 --> 00:02:11.507
This plantation belongs to me!

00:02:11.548 --> 00:02:12.966
-Stay away from this, little brother!
-This plantation belongs to me!

00:02:13.008 --> 00:02:14.009
-Just hack him off!
-This is mine!

00:02:14.051 --> 00:02:15.385
-This plantation belongs to me.
-What the hell!

00:02:16.803 --> 00:02:17.638
[groans in pain]

00:02:19.556 --> 00:02:20.390
[groans in pain]

00:02:20.933 --> 00:02:21.600
-Suri!
-My hand!

00:02:21.642 --> 00:02:23.894
Suri! Suri!

00:02:25.771 --> 00:02:27.564
Oh no, Suri! [sobbing]

00:02:28.065 --> 00:02:29.858
You killed my husband!

00:02:29.942 --> 00:02:32.069
You have unfairly killed
our little brother, Brother!

00:02:32.778 --> 00:02:35.072
Oh God! [sobbing]

00:02:35.447 --> 00:02:37.658
All of you, have killed my husband!

00:02:37.824 --> 00:02:40.953
I have pleaded not to get into a brawl.

00:02:41.036 --> 00:02:42.871
Poor, Brother Suri!

00:02:44.164 --> 00:02:45.457
-Jagadee
-Yes, Father.

00:02:45.541 --> 00:02:47.292
Remember this all the time.

00:02:47.334 --> 00:02:52.422
Agonising woman and the tears of
a man is considered a bad omen.

00:02:52.589 --> 00:02:56.510
TUCK JAGADISH

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.558
Aren't you feeding cattle well that
they are giving low milk yield?

00:03:12.943 --> 00:03:14.027
Can you drop me in the village, sir?

00:03:14.152 --> 00:03:15.195
-What do you say, sir?-Get in.

00:03:26.206 --> 00:03:27.207
My name is Lingalu.

00:03:28.083 --> 00:03:29.877
Are you the newly appointed
M.R.O of our village?

00:03:30.085 --> 00:03:30.919
Yes.

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:33.630
You do know the history of Bhudevipuram
and still came here, aren't you?

00:03:34.298 --> 00:03:36.592
I don't think you know.
Otherwise, why would you come?

00:03:37.551 --> 00:03:38.802
This is the Vermillion of the deity who
protects our village boundary.

00:03:39.428 --> 00:03:40.888
Apply this on your forehead and
you'll be blessed with good luck.

00:03:43.432 --> 00:03:45.434
It suits you!

00:03:47.811 --> 00:03:50.147
Let me tell you a tale about Bhudevipuram.

00:03:50.981 --> 00:03:51.815
What is it?

00:03:54.484 --> 00:03:55.861
The tale of papaya.

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:02.034
Why did you take this fruit?

00:04:02.201 --> 00:04:05.078
If we let him off for mere papaya,
he'd come to the farm next time!

00:04:05.204 --> 00:04:08.415
Hey! Seri Naidu is not letting the water
from lake to pass into my field.

00:04:09.041 --> 00:04:10.417
When I told him that
my crop would shrivel,

00:04:10.751 --> 00:04:12.794
he claimed that he owns
the water that passes through his field

00:04:13.003 --> 00:04:14.171
and kicked me on my chest.

00:04:15.297 --> 00:04:17.174
When that's the case, the papaya
that fell in my farm belongs to me.

00:04:17.424 --> 00:04:18.258
Hey!

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:19.801
Is it?

00:04:20.135 --> 00:04:23.639
If I sleep with your wife in
my farm, will she become mine?

00:04:23.764 --> 00:04:25.807
-Rascal! What the hell are you blabbering!
-Narayana, calm down!

00:04:26.099 --> 00:04:28.018
Seri Naidu, mind your words.

00:04:28.477 --> 00:04:29.895
First, keep your people under control.

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:32.022
Adiseshu is intentionally
provoking Narayana.

00:04:32.189 --> 00:04:33.398
-[in unison] What are you talking about?
-Ramana, calm down!

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:34.233
-Calm down.
-[overlap of voices] What are you talking!

00:04:34.274 --> 00:04:34.983
What the hell are you talking?

00:04:35.025 --> 00:04:36.276
You are the ones who are provoking us!

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:39.238
Naidu, this is a general meeting,
not a village council.

00:04:39.404 --> 00:04:40.739
If he steals again...

00:04:40.864 --> 00:04:42.241
Here, my word is an edict!

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:44.284
-Narayana!
-Brother in law!

00:04:46.787 --> 00:04:49.122
Veerendra Naidu is the
son of late Seri Naidu.

00:04:50.082 --> 00:04:51.917
Despite knowing that
Narayana killed his father,

00:04:52.292 --> 00:04:55.838
he is taking care of Narayana's family
and evolved as a deity to our village.

00:04:56.964 --> 00:05:00.175
Everyone in our village
is bound to his words and deeds.

00:05:00.342 --> 00:05:04.471
And you, as an MRO, shall follow
his path and be in your limits.

00:05:05.138 --> 00:05:06.139
Pull over!

00:05:08.016 --> 00:05:09.726
I know my responsibilities as an MRO.

00:05:12.062 --> 00:05:12.896
Get out!

00:05:13.063 --> 00:05:13.939
Out!

00:05:14.523 --> 00:05:15.691
Idiot!

00:05:18.235 --> 00:05:19.236
Let's go.

00:05:29.663 --> 00:05:35.586
[kid crying]

00:05:38.881 --> 00:05:39.882
Sir...

00:05:40.716 --> 00:05:42.426
When will my husband
come out of the prison?

00:05:43.177 --> 00:05:44.720
You said that you'd get him out on bail.

00:05:45.095 --> 00:05:46.597
Despite sleeping with me all these days,

00:05:47.264 --> 00:05:49.850
you are still longing for your husband.

00:05:50.726 --> 00:05:52.477
Am I not satisfying you?

00:05:52.978 --> 00:05:53.896
Or...

00:05:54.396 --> 00:05:56.607
Is Narayana better than me?

00:05:57.941 --> 00:05:59.776
This kid needs a father, sir.

00:06:00.485 --> 00:06:01.486
Father?

00:06:02.154 --> 00:06:03.447
The lawyer is working on the same.

00:06:03.614 --> 00:06:04.448
Bali Reddy,

00:06:05.657 --> 00:06:06.783
drop her at the house.

00:06:11.205 --> 00:06:12.206
Do you have any sense?

00:06:12.581 --> 00:06:16.543
Will you release your father's
murderer just to sleep with her?

00:06:19.254 --> 00:06:21.298
Narayana, are you missing your child?

00:06:21.381 --> 00:06:22.174
Yes, sir.

00:06:22.216 --> 00:06:24.760
Since Mr Veerendra has forgiven
you, you need not worry at all.

00:06:28.931 --> 00:06:30.057
Bastard!

00:06:33.435 --> 00:06:36.188
Sir... Sir... Please spare me!

00:06:36.438 --> 00:06:37.272
Don't kill me!

00:06:37.814 --> 00:06:39.316
Sir... Sir... I plead you!

00:06:39.816 --> 00:06:43.195
[Narayana groans in pain]

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:47.991
What if Narayana's wife
comes to know about this?

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:49.368
She will die too.

00:06:52.746 --> 00:06:53.580
Mr Veerendra.

00:06:54.581 --> 00:06:56.416
The new MRO isn't the kind who'd obey us.

00:06:57.417 --> 00:06:58.293
Seems like he is very stubborn.

00:07:01.922 --> 00:07:06.426
Mr Naidu, the lake must be extended
to supply water to other farms.

00:07:06.593 --> 00:07:07.594
This is government's decision.

00:07:07.928 --> 00:07:11.098
But the farmers of your village are
not approving. Persuade them, sir.

00:07:11.974 --> 00:07:15.853
Back in those days, Lake Bhudevi was
an abundant water source for four villages.

00:07:17.604 --> 00:07:19.273
Greed larger than hunger

00:07:19.773 --> 00:07:24.403
made them encroach the lake.

00:07:25.529 --> 00:07:27.656
I will convince the farmers.

00:07:28.407 --> 00:07:29.241
But...

00:07:29.408 --> 00:07:30.242
Sir...

00:07:30.367 --> 00:07:32.244
There are fields of these
farmers on one side of the lake.

00:07:32.578 --> 00:07:35.205
And on the other side, there are
fields encroached by Veerendra.

00:07:35.622 --> 00:07:39.751
Now, Mr Naidu is sceptical
about Veerendra's decision.

00:07:39.835 --> 00:07:41.879
[car approaching]

00:07:49.845 --> 00:07:53.307
Mr Naidu would say anything
because he has nothing to lose.

00:07:53.682 --> 00:07:55.017
But what about me?

00:07:57.019 --> 00:07:58.520
Can't you tolerate me prospering?

00:07:59.813 --> 00:08:01.815
Why do you have so much against me?

00:08:03.483 --> 00:08:05.861
Your father was against
this when he was alive.

00:08:06.278 --> 00:08:07.279
Now, you are doing the same.

00:08:09.198 --> 00:08:10.240
What will you gain from this?

00:08:11.074 --> 00:08:12.117
Satisfaction.

00:08:13.118 --> 00:08:15.412
You ruined my father's political career.

00:08:16.163 --> 00:08:17.831
You are the reason for his death!

00:08:18.248 --> 00:08:20.542
Everyone knows how your father died.

00:08:21.293 --> 00:08:24.129
People shouldn't suffer because
of our family disputes.

00:08:24.338 --> 00:08:26.757
Huh? Should I suffer then?

00:08:26.882 --> 00:08:27.966
It is of no use to talk
with this old man, Bro.

00:08:28.050 --> 00:08:29.343
-Mind your words!
-Bose, calm down.

00:08:29.510 --> 00:08:31.011
-[overlap of voices]
-Veerendra, ask your men to calm down.

00:08:31.094 --> 00:08:31.803
I'll kill you.

00:08:31.845 --> 00:08:32.721
-I'll ensure your fall!
-I'll destroy all of you!

00:08:32.763 --> 00:08:34.223
-Hey, back off
-Back off!

00:08:35.224 --> 00:08:37.518
Mr Veerendra, everything would be alright
if you hand over the lands on your own.

00:08:37.935 --> 00:08:41.230
Else, I know how to settle this legally.

00:08:41.605 --> 00:08:46.443
Well, you will face the wrath of
Mother Earth if you mess with my lands.

00:08:47.152 --> 00:08:47.986
Let's go, Guys.

00:08:52.491 --> 00:08:54.201
Don't worry about losing your farms.

00:08:54.368 --> 00:08:56.870
I will allocate my farms
to you at some other place.

00:08:57.037 --> 00:08:58.539
[in unison] Thank you, sir.

00:09:02.709 --> 00:09:04.753
Veerendra's men are trying
to kill me at the guest house.

00:09:05.003 --> 00:09:07.089
Please save me, sir.

00:09:08.173 --> 00:09:09.591
-Hey, he is over there.
-Sir... Please save me, sir.

00:09:23.772 --> 00:09:25.065
-[stabs]
-[groans]

00:09:44.084 --> 00:09:47.629
Mr Naidu, the MRO has
been hanged to death!

00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:50.424
Let's go.

00:09:53.552 --> 00:09:55.053
Greetings, sir.

00:10:02.477 --> 00:10:05.772
He used to siphon off public fund
when he worked at the agency region.

00:10:05.814 --> 00:10:08.358
Will the Naxalites keep quiet?
They have killed him.

00:10:11.236 --> 00:10:14.573
Why would Naxalites kill
the MRO who came to develop the village?

00:10:14.990 --> 00:10:16.867
I'm sure Veerendra did this, Mr Naidu.

00:10:16.909 --> 00:10:19.953
Bhudevipuram will become a graveyard
if murderers like this join politics.

00:10:20.454 --> 00:10:22.789
Veerendra should not win the ZPTC
election under any circumstances.

00:10:23.123 --> 00:10:24.917
We are planning to nominate
Mr Bose in the election.

00:10:27.836 --> 00:10:30.672
-Bose is too honest to be in politics--
-Father...

00:10:32.799 --> 00:10:36.011
Someone who is not scared of
Veerendra has to stand up for the people.

00:10:36.845 --> 00:10:37.679
Mr Ram Murthy,

00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:40.807
arrange a meeting with
all the local leaders.

00:10:41.934 --> 00:10:47.856
Let's ask them to take a stand against
Veerendra, regardless of his threats.

00:10:48.065 --> 00:10:49.066
Sure!

00:10:49.066 --> 00:10:51.276
[rooster clucking]

00:11:04.998 --> 00:11:06.166
Hey, stop... Stop...

00:11:11.505 --> 00:11:13.048
A new car without lemons
hangings or any Vermillion spots.

00:11:13.215 --> 00:11:14.967
It should be Mr Jagadish's car.

00:11:15.676 --> 00:11:16.969
Why did he stop here?

00:11:29.273 --> 00:11:30.107
Mr Jagadish...

00:11:49.668 --> 00:11:51.336
Mr Jagadish, why are you here?

00:11:52.254 --> 00:11:54.339
Are you performing
first aid to a rooster?

00:11:54.756 --> 00:11:55.591
Wow!

00:11:57.092 --> 00:11:58.051
Who is he?

00:11:58.343 --> 00:12:00.095
Looks like a broiler rooster
among country broods.

00:12:00.345 --> 00:12:01.180
Why is he holding our rooster?

00:12:01.346 --> 00:12:03.223
Why should we care?
Hey, give us our rooster.

00:12:03.265 --> 00:12:04.099
Come on, give.

00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:05.434
Look,

00:12:05.767 --> 00:12:07.603
It fell on my car when I'm on my way.

00:12:08.645 --> 00:12:11.481
It looked at me with
agony seeking help.

00:12:11.732 --> 00:12:14.818
I looked at it and offered a helping hand.

00:12:15.152 --> 00:12:18.155
There's been an exchange
of emotions involuntarily.

00:12:19.198 --> 00:12:20.699
I don't know about other roosters,

00:12:21.116 --> 00:12:21.992
spare this one!

00:12:21.992 --> 00:12:24.745
How can we? This is the aspect
of my brother-in-law's pride.

00:12:24.912 --> 00:12:25.746
I will give five grand.

00:12:25.996 --> 00:12:28.832
You can't buy his pride with money.

00:12:29.041 --> 00:12:30.876
-I think this is ten grand, not five.
-Oh, ten?

00:12:31.084 --> 00:12:33.629
Are you trying to buy his
self-respect with mere ten grand?

00:12:34.421 --> 00:12:36.632
See, how he is nodding negatively.

00:12:36.965 --> 00:12:38.300
You dimwits!

00:12:38.467 --> 00:12:40.093
He is offering us money.

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:41.929
Why are you still talking about pride?

00:12:43.388 --> 00:12:44.389
Have the rooster, sir.

00:12:46.808 --> 00:12:51.188
You just bought honour,
pride and self-respect for ten grand.

00:12:51.939 --> 00:12:53.357
What if this situation
happened in Bhudevipuram?

00:12:54.775 --> 00:12:55.609
Woah!

00:12:56.193 --> 00:12:57.653
BHUDEVIPURAM

00:12:57.903 --> 00:12:58.820
[car honks]

00:13:05.577 --> 00:13:06.870
Sir, Mr Jagadish has arrived.

00:13:08.247 --> 00:13:09.248
We have to meet Mr Naidu.

00:13:09.456 --> 00:13:10.791
Wait, I will talk to them.

00:13:16.755 --> 00:13:17.589
Did you like the car?

00:13:18.674 --> 00:13:19.675
Mr Naidu,

00:13:20.008 --> 00:13:21.844
the farmers of
Tummalapalem want to meet you.

00:13:22.135 --> 00:13:23.178
I will be right back.

00:13:23.345 --> 00:13:24.179
How are you, Jagadish?

00:13:24.346 --> 00:13:26.181
They are suffering due to lack
of irrigation to their fields.

00:13:26.348 --> 00:13:27.182
Hey Jagadee...

00:13:27.850 --> 00:13:29.184
-Greetings, Mr Naidu.
-Greetings, sir.

00:13:29.643 --> 00:13:30.477
Greetings.

00:13:30.561 --> 00:13:32.396
It will be nearly 20 acres.

00:13:33.730 --> 00:13:34.565
What's up?

00:13:34.982 --> 00:13:36.358
What is the progress of your visa process?

00:13:36.567 --> 00:13:37.401
Ongoing, Brother.

00:13:37.901 --> 00:13:38.735
Will be done in a month.

00:13:39.278 --> 00:13:40.112
Alright.

00:13:40.612 --> 00:13:42.197
Anyway, we have no choice
but to face these disputes.

00:13:43.115 --> 00:13:45.284
There is no limit for
Veerendra's atrocities.

00:13:46.410 --> 00:13:48.245
He murdered a sincere MRO.

00:13:49.496 --> 00:13:50.664
-To stop him--
-Brother!

00:13:53.834 --> 00:13:54.835
Where is Nithya?

00:13:56.545 --> 00:13:57.171
Come

00:13:57.379 --> 00:13:58.338
Nithya, don't move.

00:13:58.505 --> 00:13:59.548
-Wait, Mother.-Catch.

00:14:03.177 --> 00:14:04.011
Wedding?

00:14:05.637 --> 00:14:06.471
Little brother Bujji...

00:14:06.847 --> 00:14:09.308
I will kill you if you
ask her to marry you.

00:14:09.558 --> 00:14:11.393
Little sister, he is crazy about Nithya.

00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:13.020
He will do anything for her.

00:14:13.228 --> 00:14:14.062
My foot!

00:14:14.271 --> 00:14:15.105
Get them married, dear.

00:14:15.272 --> 00:14:17.191
You will get two shares of the property.

00:14:17.399 --> 00:14:18.734
I won't take his share, Brother-in-law.

00:14:18.942 --> 00:14:20.569
I already have mine
in this entire property.

00:14:20.652 --> 00:14:21.278
Of course... Of course...

00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:23.155
-Who said otherwise, Ganga?
-What is it, dear?

00:14:23.405 --> 00:14:24.656
-Uncle!
-Just wait

00:14:25.115 --> 00:14:26.575
-Hey!
-Uncle!

00:14:26.617 --> 00:14:29.536
I know Brother Bose won't deny me, Father.
But I highly doubt our little brother.

00:14:29.703 --> 00:14:31.872
We cannot make out what he is
thinking behind those shades.

00:14:32.039 --> 00:14:33.207
Ask him to say that word.

00:14:33.373 --> 00:14:34.958
Hey! Say it.

00:14:35.542 --> 00:14:36.376
Come on, say it.

00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:37.586
Hey, say it.

00:14:37.836 --> 00:14:39.254
-Say it, Uncle.
-Come on, say it.

00:14:39.421 --> 00:14:40.255
-What would you lose if you say?
-Why can't you say it?

00:14:40.589 --> 00:14:41.423
I won't say.

00:14:41.715 --> 00:14:43.175
Father, he says he won't.

00:14:43.383 --> 00:14:44.885
Kid, say it.

00:14:45.344 --> 00:14:46.887
Honey, you tell him, at least.

00:14:48.514 --> 00:14:50.933
Say it, dear. Girls like to hear that.

00:14:58.232 --> 00:14:59.066
Open your mouth.

00:14:59.399 --> 00:15:01.818
Well, I will give my share
to Sister Ganga if needed.

00:15:01.985 --> 00:15:03.028
-That's it.
-Uncle, you lost your property.

00:15:03.195 --> 00:15:04.488
-Are you happy now?
-That's my brother.

00:15:04.696 --> 00:15:07.533
He might look tough from outside
but you are his favourite, Ganga.

00:15:07.699 --> 00:15:08.534
Yes, Ganga.

00:15:11.411 --> 00:15:12.329
-Sathi Babu is here.
-Eh?

00:15:12.496 --> 00:15:13.330
Sathi Babu.

00:15:16.250 --> 00:15:18.460
Sister-in-law, take Nithya inside.

00:15:23.924 --> 00:15:26.760
One shouldn't come intoxicated
to discuss auspicious things.

00:15:27.469 --> 00:15:28.720
Of course... Of course...

00:15:28.971 --> 00:15:29.930
What is it, dear?

00:15:30.430 --> 00:15:31.431
Nothing, Father.

00:15:31.974 --> 00:15:34.643
Sathi Babu wants to
set up a fertilizer store.

00:15:34.685 --> 00:15:37.980
It might cost around five lakh rupees.
He wants to discuss it with you.

00:15:38.981 --> 00:15:40.524
-Bose.
-Yes, Father.

00:15:40.524 --> 00:15:43.527
Sell the cashew harvest and give five
lakh rupees from that to Sathi Babu.

00:15:43.694 --> 00:15:44.570
Okay, Father.

00:15:44.611 --> 00:15:45.571
Sathi Babu,

00:15:46.530 --> 00:15:48.907
you can work on a new
business if one fails.

00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:51.076
But that's not possible with health.

00:15:51.410 --> 00:15:52.786
Don't ruin it by getting intoxicated.

00:15:56.248 --> 00:15:57.124
-Hey!
-Bose.

00:15:57.165 --> 00:15:57.958
Yes, Father.

00:16:00.419 --> 00:16:02.838
Jagadee, when did you come?

00:16:03.797 --> 00:16:04.840
When are you leaving for America?

00:16:05.174 --> 00:16:06.300
Is it for foreign liquor?

00:16:06.466 --> 00:16:07.301
Yes.

00:16:07.301 --> 00:16:08.969
No, not for that.

00:16:09.595 --> 00:16:10.429
Hey...

00:16:10.512 --> 00:16:12.764
I'm starting a fertilizer store.

00:16:13.015 --> 00:16:14.766
You should inaugurate it
by breaking a coconut.

00:16:15.017 --> 00:16:15.851
What do you say?

00:16:20.814 --> 00:16:21.648
Mother.

00:16:22.691 --> 00:16:24.401
You woke me at 4 am.

00:16:24.693 --> 00:16:26.695
You have been torturing
me to cook several dishes.

00:16:27.112 --> 00:16:30.199
As if he is Mr SV Ranga Rao from
the movie Mayabazar to eat all these!

00:16:30.407 --> 00:16:31.241
I'm Abhimanyu.

00:16:34.786 --> 00:16:35.621
Mother.

00:16:37.998 --> 00:16:39.833
-What's up, Tuck?
-Jagadee.

00:16:40.542 --> 00:16:41.668
Where is the Vermillion of the deity who
protects the boundary of our village?

00:16:42.002 --> 00:16:43.003
Oh, my God!

00:16:43.337 --> 00:16:45.047
You don't respect or fear God.

00:16:45.547 --> 00:16:47.883
Does anyone enter the village
without applying Vermillion?

00:16:50.719 --> 00:16:52.804
He would have prayed
while coming in the car.

00:16:53.055 --> 00:16:53.889
Caught!

00:16:56.308 --> 00:16:58.936
My ill-fate! Do you have
any respect for my words?

00:16:59.186 --> 00:17:00.020
Mother...

00:17:02.022 --> 00:17:02.856
Mother!

00:17:04.775 --> 00:17:06.944
When my mother died
after giving birth to me,

00:17:08.612 --> 00:17:10.405
you've taken good care
and raised Bose and me

00:17:11.448 --> 00:17:13.659
like your own children without
discriminating us for being

00:17:14.660 --> 00:17:15.994
the children of the other wife.

00:17:16.203 --> 00:17:18.705
Kumari, Ganga, Bose, Bujji and you...

00:17:18.956 --> 00:17:20.791
all of you are my children.

00:17:21.708 --> 00:17:22.543
Forever!

00:17:22.709 --> 00:17:25.003
Jagadee, I need a favour.

00:17:25.546 --> 00:17:26.421
You should not refuse.

00:17:29.383 --> 00:17:30.217
What is it?

00:17:30.300 --> 00:17:31.927
I took a solemn vow that

00:17:32.177 --> 00:17:34.847
I'd make you carry the holy pot tomorrow
at Goddess Bhudevi's temple carnival.

00:17:35.097 --> 00:17:36.098
-Holy pot?
-Yes.

00:17:36.515 --> 00:17:37.933
Can't we donate one lakh
rupees to the temple, instead?

00:17:38.183 --> 00:17:39.434
It is a sin.

00:17:39.726 --> 00:17:41.103
You cannot buy everything with money.

00:17:41.270 --> 00:17:42.145
Slap yourself for offending God.

00:17:42.145 --> 00:17:43.313
Slap yourself.
Come on, slap yourself.

00:17:45.774 --> 00:17:49.486
Granny, just imagine Uncle Jagadee

00:17:49.695 --> 00:17:54.032
with the holy pot on his head,
Kohl to his eyes in a silk skirt attire.

00:17:55.868 --> 00:17:57.911
Mother, I am unable to carry this.

00:17:58.245 --> 00:17:59.162
Mother...

00:18:00.163 --> 00:18:01.415
[in unison] It will do good!

00:18:04.126 --> 00:18:05.085
[in unison] Say yes.

00:18:05.460 --> 00:18:06.628
[in unison] Come on, say yes.

00:18:07.796 --> 00:18:09.965
-Yes...
-Say it.

00:18:10.966 --> 00:18:11.800
Yes.

00:18:13.927 --> 00:18:14.636
My sweet son!

00:18:23.187 --> 00:18:26.440
Hurrah! The smiles should bloom!

00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:33.864
All eyes should glitter
just like the diyas in the temple

00:18:37.576 --> 00:18:41.205
Is there anything uninteresting
in any of the six seasons?

00:18:41.538 --> 00:18:44.791
If you have the right vision,
you can turn mud into beautiful flowers

00:18:45.083 --> 00:18:48.253
I'll be with you forever

00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:53.675
Whether it be stones or thorns in the
path, our steps should make them bloom

00:18:55.844 --> 00:18:59.097
If you sit in a corner in gloom

00:19:03.060 --> 00:19:06.313
Would the trouble
that's haunting you subside?

00:19:08.690 --> 00:19:11.902
If you face it bravely...

00:19:12.236 --> 00:19:15.280
Would the fear that chases you last?

00:19:17.950 --> 00:19:21.411
Hurrah! The smiles should bloom!

00:19:25.332 --> 00:19:28.627
All eyes should glitter
just like the diyas in the temple

00:19:32.631 --> 00:19:35.509
[unclear shouting]

00:19:35.676 --> 00:19:36.677
Hey! What happened?

00:19:37.344 --> 00:19:38.887
-Why are you people fighting?
-You tell us, Mr. Bose.

00:19:39.054 --> 00:19:42.474
Mr. Bose, my daughter is in labour pains.

00:19:42.683 --> 00:19:44.601
She needs to get to a hospital urgently.

00:19:58.323 --> 00:19:59.324
Pull it harder!

00:20:09.710 --> 00:20:10.878
Everyone move aside.

00:20:11.044 --> 00:20:12.921
Let the ambulance pass. Move!

00:20:16.592 --> 00:20:20.095
Small joys and strong bonds

00:20:20.262 --> 00:20:23.265
bring back sweet memories

00:20:23.432 --> 00:20:25.475
Always remember this, Jagadee.

00:20:25.767 --> 00:20:27.978
Your team's loss is your loss.

00:20:28.145 --> 00:20:29.313
Don't let them lose.

00:20:29.563 --> 00:20:34.693
Brings the joyous
childhood days back

00:20:38.155 --> 00:20:42.034
Here comes the festival...

00:20:42.201 --> 00:20:45.746
that unites everyone

00:20:46.747 --> 00:20:49.708
Spread your friendship around

00:20:50.292 --> 00:20:53.086
Add up to your treasure of smiles

00:20:53.295 --> 00:20:58.926
Your smiles wouldn't fade away
even in the toughest times

00:21:00.260 --> 00:21:02.971
If you sit in a corner in gloom

00:21:07.643 --> 00:21:10.521
Would the trouble
that's haunting you subside?

00:21:13.148 --> 00:21:16.401
If you face it bravely...

00:21:16.860 --> 00:21:19.905
Would the fear that chases you last?

00:21:44.596 --> 00:21:48.016
When motherland is
the mother to everyone

00:21:48.433 --> 00:21:51.311
Everyone is a relative
and no one is an outsider.

00:21:55.482 --> 00:21:59.111
If you say you can fade out
the distance between relations

00:21:59.278 --> 00:22:02.406
No one can deny the fact

00:22:06.451 --> 00:22:09.788
The fragrance of a flower
is never wasted

00:22:09.997 --> 00:22:13.333
It would always spread
happiness to others

00:22:14.793 --> 00:22:20.799
When a right gift is unboxed

00:22:21.216 --> 00:22:27.055
I'd take that as the moonlight that
would stay forever as a feast to eyes

00:22:38.525 --> 00:22:40.819
If you sit in a corner in gloom

00:22:45.449 --> 00:22:48.702
Would the trouble
that's haunting you subside?

00:22:51.163 --> 00:22:53.957
If you face it bravely...

00:22:54.875 --> 00:22:57.711
Would the fear that chases you last?

00:23:02.257 --> 00:23:04.051
[thunder rumbles]

00:23:10.682 --> 00:23:12.476
Mother, why are you still up?

00:23:13.435 --> 00:23:15.395
I'm waiting for Bose.

00:23:15.979 --> 00:23:17.606
Otherwise, he will skip
dinner and go to sleep.

00:23:18.815 --> 00:23:22.152
I told you several times to take
support of a pillow for your back, Mother.

00:23:23.195 --> 00:23:25.656
Later you complain about backache.

00:23:30.911 --> 00:23:32.162
Go and sleep.

00:23:43.298 --> 00:23:44.132
What are you doing here?

00:23:45.050 --> 00:23:46.802
Uncle, let's get married.

00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:49.555
Marriage?

00:23:50.472 --> 00:23:51.557
Don't skip this topic again.

00:23:51.974 --> 00:23:54.685
After you leave, I cannot
wait for you like a crazy girl.

00:23:54.977 --> 00:23:56.186
I want to be with you, wherever you go.

00:24:07.030 --> 00:24:08.824
After Bose and I started living here,

00:24:09.408 --> 00:24:11.034
one day, you were crying profusely.

00:24:11.869 --> 00:24:13.203
When Sister Kumari asked
me to take you in my arms,

00:24:13.370 --> 00:24:15.873
I felt like she was asking me
to take her responsibility.

00:24:17.374 --> 00:24:18.834
It was the responsibility of an uncle.

00:24:20.252 --> 00:24:22.337
I'll be by your side through
all good and bad times.

00:24:23.755 --> 00:24:24.631
But I cannot be your husband.

00:24:25.841 --> 00:24:26.842
Why?

00:24:28.135 --> 00:24:28.969
This is the reason.

00:24:29.344 --> 00:24:30.846
Uncle, I'm very serious about it.

00:24:31.013 --> 00:24:32.181
Will you marry me or not?

00:24:40.564 --> 00:24:41.398
If you are not going to
stay in my life

00:24:41.565 --> 00:24:43.483
why do you think you
are responsible for me?

00:24:44.568 --> 00:24:48.197
If you had rejected me
stating I'm a village girl

00:24:48.280 --> 00:24:49.281
I would have been happy.

00:24:49.781 --> 00:24:50.490
Stop acting like a kid.

00:24:50.574 --> 00:24:52.409
I'm tired of being called a kid.

00:24:54.119 --> 00:24:55.829
You will see what this kid can do.

00:25:00.250 --> 00:25:01.084
Chandra...

00:25:02.461 --> 00:25:03.295
Chandra...

00:25:08.383 --> 00:25:09.176
Sister.

00:25:09.343 --> 00:25:10.511
Did you reject her proposal?

00:25:11.678 --> 00:25:12.554
Sister, I have never had
feelings for Chandra.

00:25:12.804 --> 00:25:14.348
Why are you giving an explanation?

00:25:16.058 --> 00:25:19.102
No one can force love.

00:25:19.561 --> 00:25:22.105
She hardly knows the difference
between love and responsibility.

00:25:23.690 --> 00:25:24.942
She will understand it eventually.

00:25:25.234 --> 00:25:28.445
I love both of you equally.

00:25:28.737 --> 00:25:30.739
Instead of messing with your
brain, come and sleep inside.

00:25:32.658 --> 00:25:33.575
What is it?

00:25:49.591 --> 00:25:50.384
Mr Kanna Babu,

00:25:50.676 --> 00:25:51.844
why are you planting stones in the canal?

00:25:52.219 --> 00:25:53.554
Don't you know this land
belongs to the government?

00:25:53.762 --> 00:25:54.763
Hey, stop the work.

00:25:55.931 --> 00:25:57.516
I'm here because it is government land.

00:25:57.724 --> 00:25:58.600
Did I enter into your bedroom?

00:25:58.809 --> 00:25:59.810
Mind your words.

00:26:03.146 --> 00:26:03.981
Who is he?

00:26:04.106 --> 00:26:04.982
He is Kanna Babu.

00:26:05.148 --> 00:26:07.109
All he does is drinking
toddy and encroaching lands.

00:26:07.234 --> 00:26:08.110
Will you stop it or not?

00:26:08.110 --> 00:26:09.027
Okay, I will stop.

00:26:09.361 --> 00:26:10.529
I will send all of them away.

00:26:10.696 --> 00:26:12.322
Shall we go to my farm and talk?

00:26:12.447 --> 00:26:14.366
Mind your words!
I will break your teeth!

00:26:14.533 --> 00:26:16.201
Kanna Babu is Veerendra Naidu's henchman.

00:26:16.368 --> 00:26:18.704
Let's not involve and report this
to Mr Bose. He will take care.

00:26:19.246 --> 00:26:20.873
-Come on, break my teeth.-Hello

00:26:25.377 --> 00:26:26.587
-Sai.
-Yes.

00:26:26.753 --> 00:26:28.881
Can I deliver a dialogue which
no one expects in this situation?

00:26:29.089 --> 00:26:29.923
Yes, please.

00:26:30.799 --> 00:26:31.633
Hey!

00:26:31.884 --> 00:26:32.926
Spare her.

00:26:33.093 --> 00:26:33.927
Uff!

00:26:34.094 --> 00:26:35.971
-What happened?
-It's awesome. Please continue!

00:26:36.471 --> 00:26:37.181
Who the hell is he?

00:26:37.222 --> 00:26:39.391
He is Tuck Jagadish,
Adisesh Naidu's younger son.

00:26:39.433 --> 00:26:41.935
He will get angry and
irritated if you untuck him.

00:26:43.187 --> 00:26:44.021
Is it?

00:26:44.438 --> 00:26:46.023
Anji, untuck him!

00:26:46.523 --> 00:26:47.858
In the meantime,
I will pull her saree out.

00:26:50.652 --> 00:26:54.740
He's got a gentle heart as soothing
as water from the black earthen pot

00:26:56.241 --> 00:27:00.120
If you provoke him,
he'll beat the hell out of you

00:27:01.955 --> 00:27:05.125
Look at his delightful smile
bundled with sharp observation

00:27:07.586 --> 00:27:10.923
He'll beat you black and blue
without letting his shades slip

00:27:13.300 --> 00:27:18.639
If you mess with his tuck,
he'll rip your spine

00:27:18.847 --> 00:27:21.016
If you stagger like a perv
after drinking toddy...

00:27:21.183 --> 00:27:22.017
Keep it. It's looking good on you.

00:27:22.142 --> 00:27:24.061
- he'll strip you and send home
-That's it!

00:27:24.394 --> 00:27:30.275
Be like a polite relative... If you mess
with him, he's gonna become a punisher

00:27:55.676 --> 00:27:56.510
[shatters]

00:27:59.221 --> 00:28:01.682
He's got a gentle heart as soothing
as water from the black earthen pot

00:28:01.807 --> 00:28:04.601
If you provoke him,
he'll beat the hell out of you

00:28:04.726 --> 00:28:07.396
Look at his delightful smile
bundled with sharp observation

00:28:07.688 --> 00:28:10.274
He'll beat you black and blue
without letting his shades slip

00:28:11.108 --> 00:28:11.942
[gasps]

00:28:14.111 --> 00:28:19.408
[panting]

00:28:19.658 --> 00:28:20.492
Thanks.

00:28:22.202 --> 00:28:23.036
What do you do here?

00:28:23.328 --> 00:28:24.204
I work as VRO.

00:28:24.204 --> 00:28:26.540
While girls like you are settling
as software engineers in the city

00:28:27.374 --> 00:28:28.709
why you are working as a VRO?

00:28:29.877 --> 00:28:31.253
I am very fond of this village.

00:28:31.545 --> 00:28:32.421
Name?

00:28:32.421 --> 00:28:33.338
Bhudevipuram.

00:28:34.256 --> 00:28:35.090
Your name?

00:28:35.340 --> 00:28:36.925
Oh! Gummadi Varalakshmi.

00:28:37.217 --> 00:28:38.051
Nice name.

00:28:38.093 --> 00:28:40.220
You are Mr Adisesh
Naidu's son, aren't you?

00:28:40.596 --> 00:28:41.430
Yes

00:28:41.763 --> 00:28:42.931
I think you don't reside in the village.

00:28:43.098 --> 00:28:44.933
Well... He visits often.

00:28:45.184 --> 00:28:46.018
It is an issue with him.

00:28:47.102 --> 00:28:48.437
Okay, thank you.

00:28:49.229 --> 00:28:50.063
Bye

00:28:55.485 --> 00:28:56.486
Shut up and get in the car.

00:29:01.617 --> 00:29:02.451
Drat!

00:29:02.659 --> 00:29:04.661
Mr Simhachalam, is MRO here?

00:29:04.703 --> 00:29:05.537
He is inside.

00:29:06.747 --> 00:29:09.041
He's been talking to Veerendra's men
ever since he arrived.

00:29:09.416 --> 00:29:10.417
It's tough to handle him.

00:29:11.210 --> 00:29:12.211
Meet him after they leave.

00:29:13.378 --> 00:29:15.964
The new MRO
is verifying all the old files.

00:29:16.215 --> 00:29:17.466
You cannot meet him today.

00:29:17.966 --> 00:29:18.926
Visit tomorrow.

00:29:19.927 --> 00:29:21.094
Bujji, did you receive the amount?

00:29:22.721 --> 00:29:23.555
Five lakh rupees.

00:29:26.099 --> 00:29:27.851
We can only earn till we are incumbent.

00:29:28.143 --> 00:29:29.311
No one cares after that.

00:29:31.188 --> 00:29:32.814
Mr Veerendra gave these survey numbers.

00:29:36.068 --> 00:29:37.361
No one should mess with these.

00:29:37.569 --> 00:29:39.988
What if anyone comes saying
pass books or online records?

00:29:40.197 --> 00:29:41.073
The computers won't work, you know.

00:29:42.241 --> 00:29:43.075
I will take care of it.

00:29:45.744 --> 00:29:46.578
What else?

00:29:47.204 --> 00:29:49.248
I heard that Mr Veerendra keeps
girls around him all the time.

00:29:49.456 --> 00:29:51.124
We have an exhibition this
Sunday in our mango plantation.

00:29:51.375 --> 00:29:52.209
Please come.

00:29:54.503 --> 00:29:55.754
Can I get a bit younger one?

00:29:56.129 --> 00:29:58.006
Sir is very romantic!

00:30:00.634 --> 00:30:01.468
-See you, sir!
-Okay!

00:30:01.969 --> 00:30:03.178
Let's meet at the mango plantation.

00:30:12.688 --> 00:30:13.522
Lakshmi, come!

00:30:15.357 --> 00:30:17.609
Sir, my name is Vara Lakshmi.
I am the V.R.O.

00:30:17.860 --> 00:30:20.696
I enquired upon coming
here about lady staff.

00:30:21.196 --> 00:30:22.364
Oh, you are Vara Lakshmi?

00:30:22.531 --> 00:30:23.365
Take your seat

00:30:23.532 --> 00:30:24.366
It's okay, sir.

00:30:24.575 --> 00:30:27.160
Sir, it's been six months that
her husband passed away.

00:30:27.327 --> 00:30:28.287
[clicking tongue]

00:30:28.453 --> 00:30:29.788
The land with survey no. 152

00:30:29.997 --> 00:30:33.000
belongs to her husband and it
should be transferred to her.

00:30:34.334 --> 00:30:35.711
She is roaming around
for a long time.

00:30:38.338 --> 00:30:40.632
If you can issue a passbook
by putting a signature...

00:30:41.466 --> 00:30:45.971
I... have a habit of working late nights.

00:30:47.973 --> 00:30:51.226
If you can come to our guest
house around 10 pm to 10.30 pm...

00:30:53.604 --> 00:30:54.438
Together...

00:30:54.605 --> 00:30:56.565
we can work on it joyfully.

00:30:59.151 --> 00:31:01.486
Get in... Get in...

00:31:01.737 --> 00:31:06.575
Right... Right...

00:31:11.455 --> 00:31:12.539
Are you Kondamma?

00:31:13.707 --> 00:31:14.541
Yes!

00:31:16.210 --> 00:31:17.711
Someone is speaking
ill about you in the backside.

00:31:18.754 --> 00:31:21.507
I thought she would do something like
this when I saw her board the bus.

00:31:21.548 --> 00:31:22.382
I will take her to task.

00:31:23.008 --> 00:31:24.343
Hey vixen!

00:31:24.676 --> 00:31:25.928
What the hell were you blabbering?

00:31:26.053 --> 00:31:28.013
What did I blabber? Who told you?

00:31:28.222 --> 00:31:29.515
[heated argument in progress]

00:31:29.848 --> 00:31:30.682
How are you doing?

00:31:38.315 --> 00:31:40.108
It's been a long time since I saw
a woman going to the office in a saree.

00:31:41.193 --> 00:31:42.319
You seem very traditional.

00:31:45.030 --> 00:31:46.365
Don't you have any other work?

00:31:47.783 --> 00:31:48.617
You men tease us on the road.

00:31:48.825 --> 00:31:49.660
Trouble us in the bus.

00:31:51.245 --> 00:31:52.538
And invite us to your guest house.

00:31:55.082 --> 00:31:56.083
The beginning two are alright...

00:31:57.209 --> 00:31:59.253
But I could not
understand the guest house part.

00:31:59.962 --> 00:32:00.879
There is a pervert!

00:32:01.588 --> 00:32:02.422
My MRO.

00:32:03.215 --> 00:32:05.133
Called me to guest house
to issue a passbook.

00:32:13.684 --> 00:32:15.978
I heard that you got a loan sanctioned
for Pedda Veerayya against his farm...

00:32:17.938 --> 00:32:19.022
Without any bribe!

00:32:20.190 --> 00:32:23.068
How can we save money
for your wedding and dowry?

00:32:23.485 --> 00:32:26.405
If a guy demands
dowry, I'll break his limbs.

00:32:27.573 --> 00:32:28.699
You would not get married in this life.

00:32:29.074 --> 00:32:30.033
-Not at all.
-Eat!

00:32:30.033 --> 00:32:30.951
-I will!-Hello.

00:32:32.953 --> 00:32:37.958
[devotional song plays in the distance]

00:32:39.334 --> 00:32:40.460
Why did you come to my home?

00:32:41.628 --> 00:32:42.462
Let's go to the guest house!

00:32:42.504 --> 00:32:43.672
I will slap you with a footwear.

00:32:44.339 --> 00:32:45.757
Why didn't you say that to MRO?

00:32:48.010 --> 00:32:48.844
Is it because he is superior?

00:32:50.095 --> 00:32:50.971
He has a superior as well.

00:32:52.431 --> 00:32:53.265
That's God.

00:32:54.183 --> 00:32:55.184
He would not stay calm.

00:32:56.310 --> 00:32:58.020
Let's go and get the passbooks issued.

00:33:01.356 --> 00:33:02.191
Trust me!

00:33:04.359 --> 00:33:05.736
He is Mr Adisesh Naidu's son.

00:33:07.070 --> 00:33:08.113
500 acres!

00:33:09.281 --> 00:33:10.449
She will definitely get married!

00:33:11.283 --> 00:33:12.117
Son...

00:33:12.284 --> 00:33:13.118
How come you are here?

00:33:14.494 --> 00:33:16.830
A small survey work with VRO.

00:33:17.247 --> 00:33:18.081
Survey?

00:33:18.665 --> 00:33:20.083
He is requesting, right? Go with him.

00:33:23.962 --> 00:33:24.796
Go, dear.

00:33:26.215 --> 00:33:27.049
Go--

00:33:28.008 --> 00:33:28.842
[chuckles]

00:33:30.010 --> 00:33:30.844
It is just...

00:33:30.969 --> 00:33:31.803
You don't have to explain.

00:33:31.970 --> 00:33:33.138
You are Mr Adisesh Naidu's son.

00:33:33.222 --> 00:33:34.223
You can take her

00:33:35.224 --> 00:33:36.058
Get back soon.

00:33:37.768 --> 00:33:38.894
-Well...
-Don't say anything.

00:33:39.061 --> 00:33:40.604
Chances like these are very rare.

00:33:49.154 --> 00:33:50.781
-Is he there?
-He came just now.

00:33:51.323 --> 00:33:52.157
Who are they?

00:33:53.825 --> 00:33:54.660
Naxalites.

00:33:55.994 --> 00:33:56.828
Naxalites?

00:33:58.205 --> 00:33:59.122
Kidding. They are my friends.

00:33:59.373 --> 00:34:00.207
Get down

00:34:00.832 --> 00:34:01.875
[chuckling]

00:34:03.877 --> 00:34:04.711
Let's go and thrash him!

00:34:05.921 --> 00:34:07.589
He should be terrified
to call even his wife to the bedroom.

00:34:08.382 --> 00:34:09.925
I'm scared. I won't come.

00:34:10.425 --> 00:34:12.719
Ramulamma was scared
like this at the beginning.

00:34:14.930 --> 00:34:18.600
Didn't she break the skull
of Rami Reddy later?

00:34:21.228 --> 00:34:24.982
Punch him with this in such a way
that it shall jolt his intestines.

00:34:25.148 --> 00:34:25.983
Hold it.

00:34:32.948 --> 00:34:33.782
Say 'Lal Salam' (Red Salute)

00:34:34.283 --> 00:34:35.117
Lal Salam.

00:34:37.369 --> 00:34:39.746
Your emotion is like
asking for a lollipop.

00:34:40.497 --> 00:34:41.915
-Emotion!
-Lal Salam!

00:34:42.082 --> 00:34:42.916
That's it.

00:34:45.711 --> 00:34:46.545

Ouch!

00:35:16.033 --> 00:35:16.867
Who are you, guys?

00:35:16.909 --> 00:35:18.911

I will make sure Veerendra kills you!

00:35:39.014 --> 00:35:39.848
Yes!

00:35:40.516 --> 00:35:41.642
That's how you
should let go of me.

00:35:41.683 --> 00:35:43.060
You don't know my background.

00:35:44.561 --> 00:35:45.854
I will kill you all!

00:35:46.480 --> 00:35:48.065
Get lost!
You should be scared.

00:35:48.148 --> 00:35:49.650
Your leader left, you too leave.

00:35:53.237 --> 00:35:54.404
Why did you get the dumbbell?

00:35:56.573 --> 00:35:58.116
No, please. It will hurt!

My hearts wishes, you

These are the starting words of love

These are the first rains

My heart can't be quiet
with all the naughty thoughts

00:37:21.325 --> 00:37:24.870
Although it knows it's crossing
boundaries venturing into to alien lands

00:37:25.078 --> 00:37:30.542
Maybe you've entered my life
as a pleasant stream on a vacant path

I'm liking this discomfort of wanting you

Hey, Suri.

00:40:25.717 --> 00:40:26.760

00:40:30.973 --> 00:40:31.723
Have you gone mad?

00:40:31.807 --> 00:40:33.141
Why did you kill my father?

00:40:46.613 --> 00:40:47.489
What happened?

00:40:47.531 --> 00:40:49.825
We immobilized Suri after he
attempted to hack Ramana, Mr Naidu.

00:40:49.992 --> 00:40:52.244
Let's kill him without
any discussion, Mr Naidu.

00:40:52.703 --> 00:40:54.788
In order to take away our
lands and woo my mother,

00:40:54.955 --> 00:40:57.249
he killed my father by
making him drink illicit liquor.

00:40:57.249 --> 00:40:58.125
Hey!

00:40:58.125 --> 00:41:00.961
She is my sister-in-law and I
consider her as my mother, you idiot.

00:41:01.461 --> 00:41:03.338
He is falling for Veerendra's lies.

00:41:03.589 --> 00:41:05.632
How are you even trusting Veerendra?

00:41:08.510 --> 00:41:09.344
Suri!

00:41:10.929 --> 00:41:13.182
Drinking illicit liquor is not
the reason for your father's death.

00:41:13.807 --> 00:41:15.017
It was jaundice.

00:41:15.350 --> 00:41:16.643
The doctor informed me.

00:41:17.227 --> 00:41:19.313
How could you think of killing your uncle?

00:41:20.022 --> 00:41:23.192
Your family would have been on the roads
if your uncle wasn't there for you.

00:41:28.113 --> 00:41:30.282
Farms and properties are not
important than close ones.

00:41:35.829 --> 00:41:36.663
Spare him.

00:41:37.956 --> 00:41:38.957
He will understand.

00:41:41.960 --> 00:41:42.794
Father, let's go

00:41:45.047 --> 00:41:45.881
Father?

Tension... Tension... Tension...

00:42:12.491 --> 00:42:13.408
What happened, Father?

00:42:14.952 --> 00:42:16.328
I am doing fine, aren't I?

00:42:18.997 --> 00:42:21.124
I know that you come here
when you are disturbed.

00:42:22.209 --> 00:42:23.043
Tell me!

00:42:25.420 --> 00:42:27.047
A 15 year old kid...

00:42:28.257 --> 00:42:31.218
How can a 15-year-old
think of killing someone?

00:42:32.386 --> 00:42:37.599
How could they get this aggression
and vengeance-seeking thoughts?

00:42:39.768 --> 00:42:41.478
Is it because of people
like Veerendra?

00:42:42.980 --> 00:42:46.108
Or is it in the soil of Bhudevipuram?

00:42:49.361 --> 00:42:51.029
When will this village reform?

00:42:52.364 --> 00:42:55.158
When I think of our
family and this village...

00:42:59.371 --> 00:43:00.330
The other day...

00:43:01.498 --> 00:43:04.710
When I married your mother
under unavoidable circumstances,

00:43:06.879 --> 00:43:09.256
I was very skeptical.

00:43:13.427 --> 00:43:16.930
But all of you are living
together with harmony...

00:43:20.475 --> 00:43:21.310
Jagadee,

00:43:22.519 --> 00:43:23.937
Bose and you

00:43:25.314 --> 00:43:28.901
should protect this family
like an eye-lid protects the eye.

00:43:40.078 --> 00:43:41.079
Don't get so emotional, Father?

00:43:42.706 --> 00:43:44.124
Do you remember what you
told me in my childhood?

00:43:46.835 --> 00:43:49.171
Do you still remember that?

00:43:50.631 --> 00:43:51.590
I will remember it till my last breath.

00:43:56.762 --> 00:43:57.679
Go, and sleep!

00:44:00.015 --> 00:44:02.017
Can I sleep here along
with you, for tonight?

00:44:04.228 --> 00:44:08.690
Since I had a talk with you,
I can now sleep peacefully. You go home.

00:44:14.905 --> 00:44:15.739
Don't you need anything else?

00:44:16.532 --> 00:44:18.283
No.

00:44:20.744 --> 00:44:22.120
Not even a small peg?

00:44:27.167 --> 00:44:28.001
Go

00:44:32.548 --> 00:44:33.841
-Bye, Father.
-Bye.

00:44:38.178 --> 00:44:39.012
How is it?

00:44:41.723 --> 00:44:43.308
I have never gone out
of the village at these hours.

00:44:44.184 --> 00:44:45.269
This is my first time.

00:44:47.521 --> 00:44:48.355
What did you tell your father?

00:44:49.773 --> 00:44:51.024
I told him that I was going with you.

00:44:51.942 --> 00:44:52.901
Why should I lie about it?

00:44:54.570 --> 00:44:55.654
Won't you ever lie?

00:44:56.488 --> 00:44:57.322
Never.

00:44:58.574 --> 00:44:59.408
What if you had to?

00:45:00.659 --> 00:45:01.660
I will stay silent.

00:45:02.619 --> 00:45:03.453
What about you?

00:45:05.706 --> 00:45:06.540
I never speak truth.

00:45:08.208 --> 00:45:09.042
What if you had to?

00:45:12.421 --> 00:45:13.255
I will remain silent.

00:45:20.387 --> 00:45:23.599
I'm worried about the call from
your father at this hour, Bose.

00:45:23.724 --> 00:45:25.809
[gasping out of breath]

00:45:27.603 --> 00:45:28.437
-Father...
-Mr Naidu...

Father... Father...

00:45:30.063 --> 00:45:30.981
What happened, Father?

00:45:31.899 --> 00:45:33.567
Breathe... I can't breathe!

00:45:33.775 --> 00:45:36.361
-Let's go to the hospital.
-No... No...

00:45:36.778 --> 00:45:37.613
I won't live.

00:45:38.530 --> 00:45:40.324
I can feel it, Bose.

00:45:42.326 --> 00:45:43.327
Murthy?

00:45:44.870 --> 00:45:48.498
Write the will stating that the farms
near lake goes to Ganga and Kumari,

Casuarina plantation to Bujji,

00:45:52.211 --> 00:45:56.757
and coconut plantation
to the one who is mute.

00:45:57.716 --> 00:46:01.053
Bose gets the farms near the hill.

00:46:01.553 --> 00:46:07.142
Jagadee doesn't know to farm.
Give him anything he asks for.

00:46:11.522 --> 00:46:13.315
Bose... Bose...

00:46:14.149 --> 00:46:17.986
After me... After me...

00:46:18.195 --> 00:46:19.029
Mr Naidu!

00:46:21.823 --> 00:46:25.118
He, who did everything for the welfare
of the people all his life, is no more.

00:46:26.286 --> 00:46:27.120
Mr Bose,

00:46:28.622 --> 00:46:31.792
-Every word he uttered must be--
-Must be?

00:46:33.460 --> 00:46:35.963
The children of the first wife shall
have the farms near the lake.

00:46:36.839 --> 00:46:39.591
And the children of the second wife
shall have the farms near the hill.

00:46:40.592 --> 00:46:42.135
What kind of justice is this, Lawyer?

00:46:47.850 --> 00:46:49.476
I have been observing since childhood...

00:46:50.519 --> 00:46:52.729
Why do you love daughters so much?

00:46:54.064 --> 00:46:55.899
You took good care of them
and got them married as well.

00:46:56.650 --> 00:46:59.528
You let their husbands
stay with us and raised them like pigs.

00:47:00.904 --> 00:47:05.033
I tolerated all that just because I'll
inherit all the assets after your death.

00:47:07.286 --> 00:47:08.829
But even during your last moments,

00:47:09.329 --> 00:47:12.416
you wanted to give the share
to Kumari, Ganga and Bujji.

00:47:13.959 --> 00:47:16.503
I will give no piece of land to anyone.

00:47:17.713 --> 00:47:18.964
Everything is mine.

00:47:30.017 --> 00:47:30.851
Lawyer,

00:47:31.894 --> 00:47:33.437
just forget everything that happened here.

00:47:34.897 --> 00:47:37.274
Else you will die just like the M.R.O.

00:47:39.276 --> 00:47:43.155
Sir, Veerendra's men are at my guest
house to kill me. Please save me.

00:47:48.327 --> 00:47:49.536
Bose, stay away from this.

00:47:51.038 --> 00:47:52.122
It is not your issue.

00:47:52.497 --> 00:47:53.540
Even I'm trying to say the same.

00:47:54.833 --> 00:47:56.210
I don't care about him.

00:47:58.003 --> 00:48:00.088
If you are angry about
mere two acres of land,

00:48:01.006 --> 00:48:03.342
imagine how much angry I
should be for ten acres of land.

00:48:04.760 --> 00:48:08.347
I too would have issues
with such good M.R.O.

You can even have that
ZTPC chairman position.

00:48:37.584 --> 00:48:40.963
But I need all the lands which my father
has freely distributed to the farmers.

00:48:43.757 --> 00:48:47.803
I must be the one with vast
amount of lands in Bhudevipuram.

00:48:53.392 --> 00:48:56.311
Though you have worked for my
father, you need not display loyalty.

00:48:57.187 --> 00:49:00.816
Think of your family
and forsake the village.

[weeping]

00:50:12.387 --> 00:50:14.890

May his soul rest in peace.

00:50:18.018 --> 00:50:19.102
Be brave.

[people weeping]

00:50:56.515 --> 00:51:02.479
[intensified sobbing]

00:51:22.374 --> 00:51:23.542
-Sai...
-Coming!

00:51:23.625 --> 00:51:24.418
Keep it in the car.

00:51:24.501 --> 00:51:25.294
Jagadee...

00:51:26.086 --> 00:51:26.920
where are you going?

00:51:27.254 --> 00:51:28.255
I have an interview, Sister.

00:51:29.214 --> 00:51:30.883
We all are grieving
over our father's death.

00:51:31.800 --> 00:51:34.261
How can you leave us instead
of staying here as a support?

00:51:36.430 --> 00:51:38.140
Look at our mother's situation.

00:51:40.767 --> 00:51:43.020
She didn't even consume
a drop of water since morning.

00:51:47.524 --> 00:51:48.358
What is this, Mother?

00:51:49.902 --> 00:51:52.362
How can you not eat anything and weep
all day whenever you think of father?

00:51:53.906 --> 00:51:55.699
All are worried about you.

00:51:57.868 --> 00:51:59.620
No one would eat if you don't.

00:51:59.953 --> 00:52:00.787
Sister-in-law...

00:52:01.872 --> 00:52:02.706
Get the food plate.

00:52:05.459 --> 00:52:07.461
Take a look at the child.
She is apprehensive.

00:52:08.170 --> 00:52:09.004
Nithu...

00:52:14.801 --> 00:52:17.596
The thought of father not being here...

00:52:20.265 --> 00:52:22.518
He left me all alone...

00:52:23.018 --> 00:52:24.061
Father is here with us.

00:52:25.646 --> 00:52:27.231
He is in Bose... He is in me...

00:52:27.481 --> 00:52:28.899
He is within every one of us.

00:52:32.194 --> 00:52:36.114
Father's words, love and memories...

00:52:38.909 --> 00:52:40.118
All these make up father, right?

00:52:42.663 --> 00:52:45.457
Can father's soul be
at peace if you keep grieving?

00:52:51.964 --> 00:52:54.299
If we be brave and
live together happily,

00:52:57.511 --> 00:52:59.221
it is like having father among us.

00:53:05.227 --> 00:53:06.061
Chandra...

00:53:06.687 --> 00:53:07.521
Feed her.

00:53:11.692 --> 00:53:12.526
Brother,

00:53:12.943 --> 00:53:13.777
you should take care
of everything from now.

00:53:17.281 --> 00:53:18.115
I will take care.

00:53:19.408 --> 00:53:20.284
You go safely and
attend the interview.

00:53:29.334 --> 00:53:32.588
[people hailing] Hail Veerendra!

00:53:33.213 --> 00:53:35.340
Mr Bose, how can you decline
nomination now?

00:53:36.592 --> 00:53:38.677
I lost interest in politics
post my father's death.

00:53:39.678 --> 00:53:41.263
I even gave a thought about
it while coming in the car.

00:53:41.513 --> 00:53:42.681
I am not the right person for it.

00:53:43.682 --> 00:53:44.516
Leave me alone.

00:53:46.268 --> 00:53:47.936
You fulfilled your promise, Bose.

00:53:49.897 --> 00:53:51.481
Careful, the fish has too many bones.

00:53:52.983 --> 00:53:54.151
As per my word,

00:53:54.943 --> 00:53:58.530
I'll get the lands your father distributed
to the people registered in your name.

00:53:59.364 --> 00:54:00.699
The M.R.O will be working on it.

00:54:04.703 --> 00:54:05.913
He is Mr Gali Somaraju.

00:54:06.496 --> 00:54:09.416
My windmill projects have been
setup in all the neighbouring villages,

00:54:09.666 --> 00:54:11.376
except Bhudevipuram.

00:54:12.461 --> 00:54:13.879
Your father didn't let it happen.

00:54:14.630 --> 00:54:15.714
Bose is not like his father.

00:54:16.298 --> 00:54:17.132
He is intelligent.

00:54:18.467 --> 00:54:20.802
They want to launch
a windmill project in our village.

00:54:21.553 --> 00:54:24.806
If you can lease your land to him,
he will give a good percentage of share.

00:54:28.810 --> 00:54:30.521
I know that you won't venture into
anything without a profit, Veerendra.

00:54:31.355 --> 00:54:32.189
Cut to the chase.

00:54:33.023 --> 00:54:34.316
[chuckles]

00:54:35.692 --> 00:54:36.527
Tiru...

00:54:44.785 --> 00:54:46.203
He is Tirumala Naidu, my brother.

00:54:47.454 --> 00:54:49.957
He wants to marry your niece Chandra.

00:54:51.625 --> 00:54:53.752
I've been crazy about her
for a long time, Mr Bose.

00:54:54.670 --> 00:54:58.340
My mother also wants me
to marry a girl from your family.

00:55:02.845 --> 00:55:04.805
Your niece will be very happy here.

00:55:08.725 --> 00:55:09.893
I have no objection for this marriage.

00:55:11.395 --> 00:55:13.188
But there shouldn't be
any changes in our deal.

00:55:14.731 --> 00:55:15.899
Will your brother agree?

00:55:17.943 --> 00:55:18.902
I will take care of him.

00:55:22.531 --> 00:55:24.283
An alliance with Veerendra's family?

00:55:26.451 --> 00:55:28.245
We are not on good terms, right Bose?

00:55:28.662 --> 00:55:31.498
Bose will have a reason for that, Devudu.

00:55:32.624 --> 00:55:34.501
Father told me something
during his last moments.

00:55:36.545 --> 00:55:38.046
The day these two families unite,

00:55:38.213 --> 00:55:39.548
is the day vengeance in this village ends.

00:55:41.049 --> 00:55:44.553
Moreover, Veerendra came to our home
and consoled us when father passed away.

00:55:47.222 --> 00:55:48.682
Veerendra's brother is a very nice guy.

00:55:49.224 --> 00:55:51.185
He is well educated and wanted
to do some good to our village.

00:55:51.685 --> 00:55:52.728
I've spoken to him.

00:55:52.895 --> 00:55:54.771
He likes Chandra very much.

00:55:57.065 --> 00:55:58.108
She grew up in my hands.

00:55:58.358 --> 00:56:01.778
Imagine how much thought
I'd have put on her marriage.

00:56:03.280 --> 00:56:04.990
I feel you are right, Bose.

00:56:05.824 --> 00:56:06.992
On top of that, your father's word.

00:56:08.035 --> 00:56:10.370
You've put more thinking
than me about my daughter.

00:56:11.705 --> 00:56:12.706
Let's do it.

00:56:13.332 --> 00:56:15.918
-Well, let's call Jagadee.
-Not needed.

00:56:16.919 --> 00:56:19.421
Uncle Bose, I will marry him.

00:56:20.088 --> 00:56:22.424
But I don't want Uncle Jagadee
to attend my wedding.

00:56:22.883 --> 00:56:24.510
Why are you speaking like that?
How can this wedding happen without him?

00:56:24.718 --> 00:56:25.719
-Mother, calm down.
-What happened to her?

00:56:26.094 --> 00:56:27.679
I should get married
by the time he returns.

00:56:27.888 --> 00:56:29.431
Else, I will not marry in this life.

00:56:29.681 --> 00:56:31.767
She is a kid. Ignore her innocent words.

00:56:32.309 --> 00:56:33.769
Call him, he will be happy.

00:56:34.144 --> 00:56:36.438
-Call him, Bose.
-Call him, he will be happy.

00:56:36.897 --> 00:56:37.606
-Call him.
-Call him, Brother.

00:56:37.689 --> 00:56:38.565
Well...

00:56:39.149 --> 00:56:42.361
Jagadish hates Veerendra since
childhood because of our family disputes.

00:56:43.195 --> 00:56:46.949
He might worry if we call and inform him
about the wedding with Veerendra's brother.

00:56:47.366 --> 00:56:48.367
We can speak to him after his return.

00:56:48.534 --> 00:56:50.035
He will be here by the wedding time.

00:56:50.369 --> 00:56:52.746
True, Brother. It is better
to inform him after his return.

00:56:56.416 --> 00:56:58.710
Brother, you have
thought through this, right?

00:57:02.256 --> 00:57:05.133
Brother Bose will preside
over the wedding.

00:57:08.136 --> 00:57:11.807
[wedding percussions]

00:57:12.057 --> 00:57:13.267
Smile a bit.

00:57:15.269 --> 00:57:15.978
Mr Bose,

00:57:16.019 --> 00:57:18.480
a marriage in Mr Naidu's family is
considered as a carnival of 10 villages.

00:57:18.522 --> 00:57:20.691
But why have you arranged
a simple wedding in the temple?

00:57:20.858 --> 00:57:22.025
What's wrong in it?

00:57:22.234 --> 00:57:23.861
Union of our families is a carnival.

00:57:24.528 --> 00:57:26.405
We wanted that to happen
in the presence of God.

00:57:26.572 --> 00:57:27.406
It is a good thing.

00:57:32.536 --> 00:57:34.955
Did you see Chandra's face, Mother?
It is very delightful.

00:57:35.539 --> 00:57:37.416
Why didn't Jagadee come yet?

00:57:37.541 --> 00:57:39.793
We know him, right?
He never comes on time.

00:57:39.960 --> 00:57:41.461
He will be here soon. Don't worry.

00:57:41.670 --> 00:57:43.172
Bose, where is Jagadee?

00:57:43.589 --> 00:57:46.091
He said he would start last night.
And now, I can't reach his phone.

00:57:47.009 --> 00:57:51.013
His absence at this time
is making me feel bad.

00:57:51.305 --> 00:57:53.182
Don't worry, stay beside Chandra.

00:57:53.515 --> 00:57:56.018
The auspicious time is ticking,
go and stay beside Chandra.

00:57:56.185 --> 00:57:57.895
Go, Kumari. I will talk to him.

00:58:01.023 --> 00:58:01.899
There is no auspicious
wedding time after this Muhurata.

00:58:02.149 --> 00:58:02.983
Brother in law,

00:58:03.400 --> 00:58:04.735
we are running out of auspicious time.

00:58:04.902 --> 00:58:05.736
Why didn't Jagadee show up yet?

00:58:06.278 --> 00:58:07.571
He will be here any minute, Satti Babu.

00:58:07.779 --> 00:58:08.864
We cannot stop the time.

00:58:09.031 --> 00:58:10.616
He will be here before
the farewell of the bride.

00:58:10.782 --> 00:58:12.409
Make arrangements
for Satyanarayana ritual. [phone ringing]

00:58:13.452 --> 00:58:14.453
Hello, Mr Jagadish...

00:58:14.453 --> 00:58:15.329
Hey, Sai.

00:58:15.996 --> 00:58:16.830
Sorry!

00:58:17.122 --> 00:58:18.582
Mom's phone is unreachable.
Let me talk to her.

00:58:18.832 --> 00:58:20.375
Why haven't you arrived yet
for your niece's wedding?

00:58:20.501 --> 00:58:22.002
Marriage? Whose wedding?

00:58:22.377 --> 00:58:23.295
Chandra's.

00:58:24.463 --> 00:58:25.130
With whom?

00:58:25.214 --> 00:58:26.882
With Veerendra Naidu's
brother, Tirumala Naidu.

00:58:26.965 --> 00:58:27.799
Why are you asking all these
details as if you don't know?

00:58:27.966 --> 00:58:29.551
Brother Bose was trying
to reach you since last night

00:58:29.635 --> 00:58:30.552
and you weren't returning the calls.

00:58:31.803 --> 00:58:32.638
How long do we have
for the wedding time?

00:58:33.388 --> 00:58:35.474
The nuptial knot is tied and
everyone is showering blessings.

00:58:35.682 --> 00:58:36.517
You please come fast.

00:58:54.535 --> 00:58:55.619
Why did you get that?

00:58:56.119 --> 00:58:56.954
Why?

00:58:57.538 --> 00:58:58.622
Can't a man do this?

00:58:59.873 --> 00:59:00.707
Take this.

00:59:05.420 --> 00:59:06.255
Ouch!

00:59:06.672 --> 00:59:07.506
Did it hurt?

00:59:08.090 --> 00:59:09.675
Sit... Sit...

00:59:10.342 --> 00:59:11.718
You seem very sensitive.

00:59:12.511 --> 00:59:13.345
Let me see.

00:59:15.597 --> 00:59:18.016
There were times when my father's
word was an edict, in this village.

00:59:19.768 --> 00:59:21.603
He wanted to get stronger in politics.

00:59:24.273 --> 00:59:25.107
Your grandfather...

00:59:26.149 --> 00:59:28.110
Your grandfather destroyed it all.

00:59:28.861 --> 00:59:30.612
He provoked the idiots

00:59:32.197 --> 00:59:34.950
and got my father killed
at the village council.

00:59:36.577 --> 00:59:38.036
Imagine how much I have
been pained about it.

00:59:40.330 --> 00:59:41.498
Let me tell you something.

00:59:41.915 --> 00:59:44.293
I married you to
destroy Mr Naidu's family.

00:59:44.710 --> 00:59:46.753
-[screaming in pain]
-Keep screaming... Louder.

00:59:47.754 --> 00:59:49.089
Your family should hear your screams.

00:59:49.256 --> 00:59:50.299
-Let go of me.
-Keep screaming... Louder.

00:59:50.632 --> 00:59:52.301
-Let go of me [screaming in pain]
-Louder...

00:59:56.763 --> 00:59:57.598
Let go of me [screaming in pain]

00:59:57.973 --> 01:00:00.934
Hey! Ask Tiru to not harm her.

01:00:01.143 --> 01:00:03.645
If her family comes to know
about this, they will kill us.

01:00:08.025 --> 01:00:08.901
-Wait!
-Jagadee!

01:00:09.151 --> 01:00:11.403
Why are you leaving
without speaking anything?

01:00:11.570 --> 01:00:13.405
How can you arrange weddings
when I'm out of town?

01:00:14.323 --> 01:00:15.157
Come here.

01:00:15.240 --> 01:00:16.200
You should have got her married too.

01:00:17.117 --> 01:00:18.243
That too with Veerendra's brother?

01:00:18.744 --> 01:00:19.578
Who got this thought?

01:00:19.620 --> 01:00:21.079
It was our brother Bose's decision.

01:00:21.288 --> 01:00:22.122
Father told him that

01:00:22.289 --> 01:00:24.124
the alliance between these two
families will be the best thing.

01:00:24.374 --> 01:00:26.084
Yes, Jagadee. We observed
the groom in the wedding.

01:00:26.084 --> 01:00:28.253
He is a good natured guy.

01:00:28.504 --> 01:00:30.756
They both were very
happy during the wedding.

01:00:30.964 --> 01:00:32.174
No one cares for my happiness.

01:00:33.175 --> 01:00:34.134
I should not attend my niece's wedding.

01:00:34.343 --> 01:00:35.177
-Isn't it?
-No!

01:00:35.928 --> 01:00:37.012
Or did you choose to
ignore me thinking that

01:00:37.262 --> 01:00:39.598
I'd be anyway leaving to the US and won't
be available to attend any ceremonies.

01:00:40.516 --> 01:00:41.350
Why will we think like that?

01:00:41.475 --> 01:00:42.684
How can she get married without me?

01:00:42.851 --> 01:00:44.686
She was the one who requested
your absence in her wedding.

01:00:44.853 --> 01:00:45.687
-Ganga...
-Sister...

01:00:45.729 --> 01:00:46.563
Why did you say that?

01:00:48.065 --> 01:00:50.275
Anyway, Brother Bose
called you several times.

01:00:50.609 --> 01:00:52.736
Did you answer the call?

01:00:52.945 --> 01:00:55.405
Why will we conduct the wedding if
we know you couldn't attend, Jagadish?

01:00:56.698 --> 01:01:01.161
Go and check on Chandramma.
You'll know how happy she is.

01:01:01.328 --> 01:01:05.415
You will praise Bose for
fixing such a good alliance.

01:01:06.083 --> 01:01:06.917
Yes, Jagadee.

01:01:07.292 --> 01:01:08.168
You will praise him for sure.

01:01:08.168 --> 01:01:09.628
Understand me, dear.

01:01:13.549 --> 01:01:14.466
Accept it.

01:01:17.135 --> 01:01:17.886
-He accepted.
-That's it.

01:01:17.970 --> 01:01:19.805
Visit them. Look at his anger.

01:01:22.224 --> 01:01:24.017
Jagadee, when did you come?

01:01:24.434 --> 01:01:25.894
I didn't expect you'd miss the wedding.

01:01:26.186 --> 01:01:27.020
Where are you going?

01:01:28.063 --> 01:01:28.897
To Chandra's home.

01:01:28.939 --> 01:01:30.774
Get back soon, let's dine together.

01:01:31.942 --> 01:01:32.943
Brother, did you call me?

01:01:33.777 --> 01:01:36.113
I tried calling several
times but couldn't reach you.

01:01:37.114 --> 01:01:38.407
Oh! You did!

01:01:38.657 --> 01:01:39.491
Of course.

01:01:39.825 --> 01:01:42.369
Get back soon, let's dine together.

01:02:01.388 --> 01:02:02.931
Wanted to see how she is doing?

01:02:05.434 --> 01:02:07.644
I asked her to call and update
you on how happy she is.

01:02:07.811 --> 01:02:08.770
Didn't I ask you?

01:02:10.230 --> 01:02:13.150
But she broke the phone stating that
she is no more related with your family.

01:02:16.945 --> 01:02:18.197
It was you who gifted
the phone, weren't you?

01:02:20.490 --> 01:02:24.036
You would have enjoyed
with your niece all these days.

01:02:24.995 --> 01:02:26.371
You can continue being like that.

01:02:27.206 --> 01:02:28.207
I'm open minded person.

01:02:29.541 --> 01:02:31.585
You can come here
even when I'm not here.

01:02:32.252 --> 01:02:34.254
You can do whatever you like.

01:02:35.589 --> 01:02:36.590
Comfortably.

01:02:39.927 --> 01:02:41.303
Come, sit here.

01:02:47.476 --> 01:02:48.977
Do you know how I address Chandra?

01:02:51.522 --> 01:02:52.439
I call her Chandramma.

01:02:54.858 --> 01:02:56.193
You can't understand
what I'm saying.

01:02:58.904 --> 01:03:01.532
If you try to frame any kind
of profane relation between us,

01:03:04.910 --> 01:03:05.911
remember, I'm not as open-minded as you.

01:03:07.704 --> 01:03:08.956
Why is your uncle warning me?

01:03:11.291 --> 01:03:12.459
Please go away from here.

01:03:13.418 --> 01:03:14.670
Don't you ever come here again.

01:03:19.842 --> 01:03:20.634
Knock back undiluted...

01:03:21.593 --> 01:03:23.679
Knock back is not
good for your health!

01:03:26.139 --> 01:03:26.974
Have butter milk.

01:03:38.235 --> 01:03:39.945
[indistinct dog barking]

01:03:50.664 --> 01:03:51.582
Why did you come again?

01:03:51.999 --> 01:03:53.000
Are you really doing good?

01:03:53.834 --> 01:03:54.668
Why are you concerned?

01:03:56.545 --> 01:03:57.504
Give that hand.

01:03:59.548 --> 01:04:03.010
Our Chandramma, who used to serve food
with right hand to anyone who cited hunger

01:04:03.969 --> 01:04:08.348
has served me buttermilk with her
left hand. That's when I understood that

01:04:12.060 --> 01:04:13.770
it was his evil work.

01:04:14.229 --> 01:04:15.606
You've rejected my wedding
proposal, haven't you?

01:04:16.732 --> 01:04:18.442
This pain is nothing
when compared to that.

01:04:21.737 --> 01:04:22.571
Listen to me.

01:04:22.946 --> 01:04:24.239
-Let's inform mother--
-If we inform them,

01:04:24.489 --> 01:04:25.490
they will die out of pain.

01:04:25.490 --> 01:04:27.201
You have to witness
my death before theirs.

01:04:27.701 --> 01:04:28.869
What is it to you if I die?

01:04:29.161 --> 01:04:30.871
-You don't even care for me.
-Assume whatever you want.

01:04:33.457 --> 01:04:35.042
But you'd feel exhausted some day

01:04:36.502 --> 01:04:38.086
that you can't tolerate him anymore.

01:04:42.216 --> 01:04:43.091
Turn on the switch on that day.

01:04:45.260 --> 01:04:46.261
The light would glow over there.

01:04:56.563 --> 01:04:59.816
I will bury him here and
take you home, Chandramma.

01:05:01.318 --> 01:05:03.820
I will come here every day
at this time to check on the light.

01:05:09.868 --> 01:05:10.702
Remember that.

01:05:21.046 --> 01:05:23.632
Brother Bose,
I expected you to come for lunch.

01:05:24.049 --> 01:05:25.259
Are you unloading coconuts?

01:05:26.718 --> 01:05:29.304
We heard that you have received
the money of the cashew harvest.

01:05:29.972 --> 01:05:32.808
Sathi Babu is planning to pay the token
amount for the fertilizer store tomorrow.

01:05:33.141 --> 01:05:35.477
If we pay two lakh rupees now,
we can pay the rest later.

01:05:35.686 --> 01:05:36.520
Yes.

01:05:36.603 --> 01:05:40.190
Hmm... Ganga, we didn't
get any profits this time.

01:05:40.983 --> 01:05:43.485
The sale amount was paid towards
the labour wages and other expenses.

01:05:44.236 --> 01:05:46.321
The yield was extremely high, right, Bose?

01:05:46.822 --> 01:05:47.865
How did we incur loss?

01:05:48.156 --> 01:05:49.533
It was infested by pests, Satti Babu.

01:05:50.450 --> 01:05:53.787
The pests came from the other
neighbouring farms, not ours.

01:05:55.038 --> 01:05:56.957
They've been feeding on us for years.

01:05:57.583 --> 01:05:59.585
Boss's language has changed, Ganga.

01:06:01.920 --> 01:06:03.922
We have to talk with Brother Devudu.

01:06:04.840 --> 01:06:06.675
Let's talk. Ask them to come.

01:06:08.260 --> 01:06:10.429
Bose, father indeed told you
to give him five lakh rupees.

01:06:10.679 --> 01:06:12.848
I've already told you that
the crop was infested by the pests.

01:06:13.015 --> 01:06:14.266
Is that pests or you?

01:06:14.433 --> 01:06:15.142
Sathi Babu!

01:06:15.184 --> 01:06:16.351
I will break your teeth!

01:06:16.518 --> 01:06:18.061
-Hey!
-Mind your words!

01:06:18.145 --> 01:06:18.937
Shut up!

01:06:18.979 --> 01:06:20.397
Bose, he told that in the heat
of the moment. Ignore him.

01:06:20.647 --> 01:06:21.690
-It was a slip of the tongue.
-Brother Devudu.

01:06:21.899 --> 01:06:23.483
I won't accept you supporting him.

01:06:23.692 --> 01:06:25.611
Sathi Babu, calm down.

01:06:25.777 --> 01:06:26.945
Why should we stay calm, Sister?

01:06:27.112 --> 01:06:29.031
We are at loss, not you.

01:06:29.448 --> 01:06:32.409
How can you speak by showing disparity?

01:06:33.619 --> 01:06:35.829
He got a good alliance for your daughter,

01:06:35.996 --> 01:06:37.664
that's why you two
are supporting him.

01:06:37.831 --> 01:06:39.333
What are you talking about, Sathi Babu?

01:06:39.416 --> 01:06:40.501
Don't talk like a drunkard!

01:06:40.667 --> 01:06:42.544
Oh, you are calling names!

01:06:42.794 --> 01:06:45.047
What if I do name-calling too?

01:06:45.214 --> 01:06:46.173
[mute gestures]

01:06:46.215 --> 01:06:47.841
Why are you getting in between, dimwit?

01:06:48.842 --> 01:06:50.511
It's not about five lakh rupees.

01:06:51.303 --> 01:06:52.679
Let's divide the properties.

01:06:53.472 --> 01:06:54.890
What is the total? And what's my share?

01:06:55.057 --> 01:06:56.141
Mother, ask him and tell us.

01:06:57.851 --> 01:06:58.685
Properties?

01:07:00.604 --> 01:07:02.397
Where on earth do you have properties?

01:07:05.651 --> 01:07:07.444
All this property was earned
after my father married my mother,

01:07:07.653 --> 01:07:10.447
when all of you were in a
state where you had nothing.

01:07:11.740 --> 01:07:13.992
You enjoyed it all these days freely.

01:07:15.035 --> 01:07:19.164
And now, all of you are faking affection
to draw a share from this property.

01:07:19.373 --> 01:07:21.542
We never thought of it, Bose.

01:07:21.708 --> 01:07:23.418
You are more than a
biological son to me, Bose.

01:07:23.669 --> 01:07:25.587
But I never considered you as a mother.

01:07:27.589 --> 01:07:28.507
I'm not your blood!

01:07:30.384 --> 01:07:31.051
Get lost!

01:07:31.885 --> 01:07:32.886
Everyone, just get lost!

01:07:41.103 --> 01:07:41.937
Bose,

01:07:42.646 --> 01:07:45.440
you might feel her as a
burden, but not for me.

01:07:46.984 --> 01:07:48.026
She will stay with us.

01:07:48.527 --> 01:07:49.361
We will take her to my home.

01:07:49.820 --> 01:07:51.488
Come with us. Come...

01:08:12.759 --> 01:08:18.140
Look, he is forcing us out of here
citing we have no share in this property.

01:08:18.807 --> 01:08:20.767
He berated us so badly.

01:08:21.310 --> 01:08:22.144
Jagadee,

01:08:23.478 --> 01:08:24.938
he called us pests.

01:08:26.523 --> 01:08:31.320
When father was alive, you promised that
you'd give me your share of your property.

01:08:31.904 --> 01:08:32.738
Give it now!

01:08:36.241 --> 01:08:38.911
No idiot who agonized
a woman will prosper.

01:08:39.077 --> 01:08:40.454
-Yes.
-Come.

01:08:51.632 --> 01:08:52.466
Brother...

01:08:53.675 --> 01:08:54.468
What is this?

01:08:56.136 --> 01:08:57.095
Jagadee,

01:08:57.638 --> 01:09:00.849
after our mother's death,
they took care of us for our properties.

01:09:01.183 --> 01:09:02.643
But now, after father's demise,

01:09:03.310 --> 01:09:05.854
they are citing some sort of
deprivation and whining over it.

01:09:06.063 --> 01:09:08.524
If we stay silent,
they will claim that this is all theirs.

01:09:09.233 --> 01:09:12.736
Arjunamma is provoking
her daughters and sons-in-law.

01:09:13.278 --> 01:09:14.112
It is wrong, Brother.

01:09:15.614 --> 01:09:17.616
Agonising mother and sisters
for the sake of property is a sin.

01:09:21.828 --> 01:09:22.829
Did you ask them to leave?

01:09:25.332 --> 01:09:26.166
Jagadee,

01:09:26.917 --> 01:09:27.835
you will not understand this.

01:09:28.794 --> 01:09:30.712
Quote a figure,
I will send it to you every month.

01:09:32.172 --> 01:09:34.299
I'm not going to give them any share.

01:09:34.508 --> 01:09:35.342
Not just share,

01:09:36.510 --> 01:09:37.886
but we can sacrifice our
lives for them as well.

01:09:39.680 --> 01:09:40.514
Let's give.

01:09:44.893 --> 01:09:45.769
At least, give them my share.

01:09:46.436 --> 01:09:47.271
Share?

01:09:49.064 --> 01:09:50.107
What are you talking about?

01:09:51.441 --> 01:09:53.986
Father never told me anything while dying.

01:09:54.653 --> 01:09:55.946
Did he tell you anything?

01:09:56.989 --> 01:09:58.657
Do you have any documents?

01:09:59.825 --> 01:10:00.659
Jagadee,

01:10:01.159 --> 01:10:02.160
you are a kid.

01:10:02.828 --> 01:10:03.662
You know nothing.

01:10:03.704 --> 01:10:04.621
Come home.

01:10:09.168 --> 01:10:10.002
Do you have a passbook?

01:10:12.504 --> 01:10:13.338
What is the survey number?

01:10:14.715 --> 01:10:16.049
He hardly stays in the village.

01:10:16.258 --> 01:10:17.217
Happy-go-lucky kind.

01:10:17.384 --> 01:10:18.218
How can he understand all these?

01:10:18.594 --> 01:10:19.428
Well said.

01:10:19.595 --> 01:10:20.429
Sir,

01:10:21.513 --> 01:10:22.764
these are Mr Naidu's farm records.

01:10:24.099 --> 01:10:27.895
Survey no. 270/a, the righteous owner is

01:10:28.395 --> 01:10:30.981
Mr Bose and the one took for lease is
Somaraju. That's what is there in it.

01:10:32.649 --> 01:10:33.817
Are you Somaraju?

01:10:35.652 --> 01:10:36.528
What about Mr Bose?

01:10:38.655 --> 01:10:39.531
Mr Bose is my brother.

01:10:39.948 --> 01:10:42.075
Then, you should discuss it with him.

01:10:43.035 --> 01:10:44.411
Follow your brother.

01:10:44.661 --> 01:10:45.662
You will have a bright future.

01:10:45.871 --> 01:10:46.997
Why do you want to suffer?

01:10:47.206 --> 01:10:48.207
Follow him.

01:10:50.959 --> 01:10:52.127
Narsayya, let's discuss it later.

01:10:52.294 --> 01:10:53.295
What will you discuss?

01:10:53.754 --> 01:10:54.755
Let's resolve this now.

01:10:54.963 --> 01:10:57.799
They are asking to return the farms
which your father had distributed to us.

01:10:57.966 --> 01:11:01.094
Someone named Somaraju
has even sent us subpoenas.

01:11:01.428 --> 01:11:03.138
You are stealing our food.

01:11:03.931 --> 01:11:05.766
How can you be the sons of Mr Naidu?

01:11:07.142 --> 01:11:08.310
He is not related to the issue.

01:11:08.602 --> 01:11:09.978
We should resolve this with Bose.

01:11:11.355 --> 01:11:12.189
Don't mind it.

01:11:13.190 --> 01:11:14.024
Let's go.

01:11:14.608 --> 01:11:15.901
We'll talk. Let's go.

01:11:18.654 --> 01:11:21.823
Bose teamed up with the M.R.O
and manipulated the land records.

01:11:23.158 --> 01:11:26.370
We cannot do anything as long
as this MRO is incumbent.

01:11:26.870 --> 01:11:27.871
Shall we complain against him?

01:11:31.750 --> 01:11:32.626
Someone complained against
me at the collector's office

01:11:32.918 --> 01:11:34.837
claiming that I am a corrupt officer.

01:11:35.170 --> 01:11:36.588
Here is my suspension order.

01:11:40.092 --> 01:11:42.344
My signature on the N.O.C
of Somaraju's project won't be valid now.

01:11:42.803 --> 01:11:45.180
Get it issued by new M.R.O.

01:11:46.640 --> 01:11:47.474
See you later.

01:11:49.810 --> 01:11:51.645
Some journalist would
have complained.

01:11:51.854 --> 01:11:53.313
Let's look into it later.

01:11:53.397 --> 01:11:54.231
Lingalu...

01:12:01.530 --> 01:12:04.116
The new M.R.O should start working with
us even before he enters into the village.

01:12:04.449 --> 01:12:06.451
If he claims he is sincere officer,

01:12:07.077 --> 01:12:10.998
he will be die like the ex-M.R.O.

01:12:20.382 --> 01:12:21.967
BHUDEVIPURAM

01:12:39.735 --> 01:12:40.986
My name is Lingalu.

01:12:41.570 --> 01:12:42.404
Mr M.R.O,

01:12:42.988 --> 01:12:44.990
You do know the history of Bhudevipuram
and still came here, aren't you?

01:12:45.407 --> 01:12:48.327
I don't think you know.
Otherwise, why would you come?

01:12:49.328 --> 01:12:50.662
I want to tell you a tale.

01:12:50.871 --> 01:12:52.331
This is the Vermillion of the deity who
protects our village boundary.

01:13:03.759 --> 01:13:07.596
[phone ringing]

01:13:08.764 --> 01:13:09.598
Lingalu

01:13:09.932 --> 01:13:11.975
Bring the new M.R.O
directly to our office.

01:13:12.893 --> 01:13:16.438
The new M.R.O is Mr Bose's brother.

01:13:27.866 --> 01:13:28.867
Veerendra,

01:13:32.412 --> 01:13:34.206
you used to tell some tales to people

01:13:35.999 --> 01:13:38.085
about papaya, and the banana plantation.

01:13:40.379 --> 01:13:43.382
Do you like to hear a tale from me?

01:13:44.800 --> 01:13:47.803
Exactly three months ago, in
Goddess Bhudevi's temple carnival,

01:13:48.053 --> 01:13:49.054
Just be patient until evening.
[carnival bustle and percussions]

01:13:49.096 --> 01:13:50.764
-Uncle Jagadee.
-Village--

01:13:54.810 --> 01:13:55.644
What happened?

01:13:57.521 --> 01:13:59.022
-Tomorrow is her matchmaking.
-Is it?

01:14:01.191 --> 01:14:02.025
Hey!

01:14:02.317 --> 01:14:03.235
Let go of me, rascal!

01:14:04.361 --> 01:14:05.112
Let go.

01:14:05.153 --> 01:14:06.363
If you like my touch,

01:14:06.530 --> 01:14:07.823
come to the backyard of the
temple. I will be waiting there.

01:14:08.365 --> 01:14:09.992
[weeping]

01:14:33.140 --> 01:14:34.349
Where is the Prasada (offering) counter?

01:14:34.683 --> 01:14:35.809
Over that corner.

01:14:37.728 --> 01:14:40.230
[groans in pain]

01:14:41.398 --> 01:14:43.483
Did he tell you that he lost
his hand in a crusher mishap?

01:14:47.279 --> 01:14:50.407
He knew that I would chop his
head-off if he had told the truth.

01:14:54.828 --> 01:14:57.998
I did all that just because
a girl from my family shed tears.

01:14:59.917 --> 01:15:05.380
Now, you betrayed my family by
joining hands with my brother.

01:15:07.799 --> 01:15:11.011
My father's wish is to see
vengeance free Bhudevipuram.

01:15:13.180 --> 01:15:14.806
Now, it's my responsibility.

01:15:16.308 --> 01:15:18.101
It is the responsibility of an M.R.O.

01:15:20.103 --> 01:15:21.772
You do know the abbreviation
of M.R.O, don't you?

01:15:23.232 --> 01:15:25.108
Mandal Revenue Officer.

01:15:26.818 --> 01:15:27.736
That is for everyone else.

01:15:28.153 --> 01:15:29.947
But for you,

01:15:31.615 --> 01:15:34.785
it is 'Mental Rowdy Officer'.

01:15:42.501 --> 01:15:44.336
Well, you are requesting a
posting at your hometown.

01:15:44.711 --> 01:15:45.754
Why should I do this favour?

01:15:46.171 --> 01:15:47.256
To reform my village, sir.

01:15:48.549 --> 01:15:50.717
Everyone forgot to live
peacefully due to the greed for lands.

01:15:51.051 --> 01:15:52.177
I want to show them a better way.

01:15:54.054 --> 01:15:55.848
I don't know if you
can accomplish it or not.

01:15:56.431 --> 01:15:58.934
I don't want to be an obstacle
for a good initiative.

01:16:00.435 --> 01:16:01.311
All the best.

01:16:05.983 --> 01:16:10.529
L Jagadish NAIDU
M.R.O

01:16:19.705 --> 01:16:21.206
How come you are an M.R.O, Jagadee?

01:16:21.915 --> 01:16:23.750
I need to discuss a personal
matter with the officer.

01:16:23.917 --> 01:16:24.877
Can you all please wait outside?

01:16:25.043 --> 01:16:26.628
-Mr Simhachalam...
-Wait.

01:16:28.755 --> 01:16:29.590
What personal?

01:16:30.632 --> 01:16:32.926
Take a step back.

01:16:37.055 --> 01:16:38.056
I am DT Srinivas, sir.

01:16:38.223 --> 01:16:39.433
I am Record Assistant Ramana, sir.

01:16:39.474 --> 01:16:40.642
I am Surveyor David Raju, sir

01:16:40.851 --> 01:16:41.935
I am Junior Assistant Yesu Babu, sir.

01:16:43.145 --> 01:16:44.146
I am R.I. Sudha Rani, sir

01:16:49.359 --> 01:16:50.986
I am V.R.O Gummadi Varalakshmi, sir.

01:16:51.820 --> 01:16:53.071
Mr Simhachalam, where
are the other V.R.Os?

01:16:53.238 --> 01:16:54.406
They will not come to the office, sir.

01:16:54.865 --> 01:16:57.201
They should come here in an hour.

01:16:57.284 --> 01:16:58.118
Okay, sir.

01:16:58.869 --> 01:17:01.371
People waiting outside shouldn't
go home without meeting today.

01:17:01.538 --> 01:17:04.917
It is not possible for you to hear
everyone's problems in one day, sir.

01:17:05.626 --> 01:17:07.294
You might be stressed.

01:17:07.753 --> 01:17:08.587
As much as possible.

01:17:09.796 --> 01:17:11.173
It's hot outside.

01:17:11.465 --> 01:17:12.841
Supply them with chairs and cold drinks.

01:17:13.175 --> 01:17:14.134
Treat them as relatives.

01:17:14.468 --> 01:17:16.762
Tell them to be comfortable
until they get their turn.

01:17:20.182 --> 01:17:22.226
Sir, whom should I call first?

01:17:22.809 --> 01:17:23.894
First come, first serve.

01:17:24.228 --> 01:17:25.062
Sure, sir.

01:17:32.778 --> 01:17:34.613
Venkat Rao, the officer is calling you.

01:17:34.947 --> 01:17:37.366
Sir, my name is Kankarla Venkat Rao.

01:17:37.950 --> 01:17:39.785
We are four brothers.

01:17:39.993 --> 01:17:42.496
There is a dispute between brothers

01:17:42.829 --> 01:17:44.831
regarding a half-acre land of banana
plantation which is on my mother's name.

01:17:44.998 --> 01:17:46.458
-Due to those disputes...
-This file contains all their records.

01:17:46.500 --> 01:17:47.960
-They aren't taking up farming...-Give this to your officer.

01:17:48.126 --> 01:17:48.961
nor letting me do that, in that land.

01:17:49.127 --> 01:17:51.505
Let him not get humiliated
by talking something irrelevant.

01:17:51.713 --> 01:17:54.341
I am having a hard time
to even provide for my family.

01:17:54.716 --> 01:17:56.468
I have been coming
to this office every day.

01:17:56.718 --> 01:17:59.221
-No one here cares.
-Sir, their farm records are in this file.

01:18:01.515 --> 01:18:03.559
There is 8 acres of banana plantation land
bearing Survey no. 170/a,

01:18:03.725 --> 01:18:05.727
near Chintal-Thop, on your father's name.

01:18:06.103 --> 01:18:09.356
He divided two acres each for
four brothers, before his death.

01:18:09.773 --> 01:18:11.942
He was skeptical about how you
brothers would treat your mother.

01:18:12.109 --> 01:18:14.820
So he assigned a half-acre bearing
survey no 170/b, on your mother's name.

01:18:15.153 --> 01:18:17.656
After her death, you brothers started
fighting over the ownership of that land.

01:18:17.990 --> 01:18:19.783
In that, the second brother lost his
hand, the third brother got killed,

01:18:19.992 --> 01:18:22.160
and the elder one went to
prison and got released recently.

01:18:22.369 --> 01:18:23.453
You started quarrelling again.

01:18:26.039 --> 01:18:28.166
Mr Simhachalam, am I correct?

01:18:28.375 --> 01:18:30.002
Much better than the record, sir!

01:18:31.753 --> 01:18:34.673
Invite all your brothers
for lunch next Sunday.

01:18:35.048 --> 01:18:36.550
Inform them that the M.R.O would be there.

01:18:37.509 --> 01:18:38.343
Let's settle it there.

01:18:38.719 --> 01:18:40.762
They hate each other, sir.

01:18:41.763 --> 01:18:42.931
Will they accept?

01:18:44.683 --> 01:18:45.934
Just a meal!

01:18:48.979 --> 01:18:49.813
Okay, sir.

01:18:54.026 --> 01:18:54.860
Next...

01:18:56.820 --> 01:18:57.946
Under any circumstances,

01:18:59.198 --> 01:19:01.325
we need a new M.R.O's sign on the NOC.

01:19:02.659 --> 01:19:04.328
But your brother will not
agree to that so easily.

01:19:04.536 --> 01:19:05.662
You have to do something and
get his signature on the NOC.

01:19:05.871 --> 01:19:06.705
Veerendra!

01:19:07.581 --> 01:19:10.083
He is an M.R.O for the
village, not for me.

01:19:10.709 --> 01:19:11.543
He is a kid.

01:19:12.377 --> 01:19:13.253
I will get the job done.

01:19:17.883 --> 01:19:19.218
Your uncle is the new M.R.O.

01:19:20.802 --> 01:19:22.387
You are acting very innocent.

01:19:24.139 --> 01:19:26.141
He bribed to get the posting here.

01:19:27.476 --> 01:19:28.977
Seems like he is still not over you.

01:19:29.311 --> 01:19:30.145
What the hell are you talking?

01:19:30.187 --> 01:19:31.021
[gasps]

01:19:45.118 --> 01:19:45.953
Mr Bose...

01:19:46.954 --> 01:19:48.539
It is first come, first serve.

01:19:48.580 --> 01:19:49.414
Hey!

01:19:49.623 --> 01:19:50.332
He is my little brother.

01:19:50.415 --> 01:19:51.625
He is our M.R.O, sir.

01:19:52.459 --> 01:19:54.127
Please wait under the tree.
We will call you.

01:19:57.840 --> 01:19:59.258
Vanaparthy Ram Chandrayya.

01:20:15.190 --> 01:20:17.025
Sir, the registration is over.

01:20:17.234 --> 01:20:18.360
But the passbook is not issued.

01:20:18.569 --> 01:20:19.403
I will take care of it.

01:20:19.820 --> 01:20:20.404
See you, sir.

01:20:20.445 --> 01:20:22.030
-Samireddy Ramulamma!
-See you.

01:20:26.243 --> 01:20:27.494
Gorlu Suri Babu

01:20:31.790 --> 01:20:32.958
Gummala Ravi Kumar.

01:20:34.835 --> 01:20:35.711
It won't happen again.

01:20:36.211 --> 01:20:37.671
I give you my word.
Go home without any worry.

01:20:42.801 --> 01:20:43.635
Mr Bose...

01:20:43.677 --> 01:20:45.554
-Hmm.
-The M.R.O is calling you.

01:20:54.062 --> 01:20:57.107
I used to wait for you for hours outside
the school.

01:20:57.941 --> 01:20:58.984
You reminded me of that again.

01:21:00.569 --> 01:21:02.487
You used to stay out
of the village disputes.

01:21:03.155 --> 01:21:05.741
Why did you become an M.R.O?

01:21:07.659 --> 01:21:12.164
I want to launch a project
here. If you sign the NOC...

01:21:12.706 --> 01:21:14.333
Our father has distributed
that land to the farmers.

01:21:15.375 --> 01:21:19.087
It means, all of us had given it.

01:21:20.255 --> 01:21:24.218
They were farming in that for the past 10
years. How can you start a project there?

01:21:25.511 --> 01:21:28.430
And the project should benefit
the farmer, not others.

01:21:31.391 --> 01:21:35.312
Moreover, enjoying all the property all by
yourself by betraying the family members

01:21:36.480 --> 01:21:38.482
is a big crime under the succession act.

01:21:40.526 --> 01:21:42.653
I have already told you

01:21:43.445 --> 01:21:45.948
that I would not even give a
penny to Arjunamma's family.

01:21:46.490 --> 01:21:50.369
I took the stay order from the court
to restrict their access to our farms.

01:21:51.203 --> 01:21:54.748
It takes, at least, 10
years to be proven wrong.

01:21:57.251 --> 01:21:59.086
You too can do nothing about
it despite being an M.R.O.

01:22:01.588 --> 01:22:04.758
Veerendra will take care of those farms.

01:22:06.552 --> 01:22:07.803
My little brother,

01:22:08.637 --> 01:22:10.639
you will be safe as long
as you listen to me.

01:22:11.390 --> 01:22:16.144
If you don't listen to me, I cannot
guarantee the safety of your life.

01:22:19.857 --> 01:22:21.191
Try to understand.

01:22:22.693 --> 01:22:24.528
Explain Veerendra the same

01:22:27.739 --> 01:22:30.576
I am unlike the ex-MRO who is
an outsider, to get killed.

01:22:32.953 --> 01:22:33.871
I am a local.

01:22:39.835 --> 01:22:41.753
Do you remember what you have
told me when I was a kid?

01:22:43.088 --> 01:22:44.965
'You will lose if your team loses.'

01:22:49.136 --> 01:22:50.304
Now, I'm saying,

01:22:51.013 --> 01:22:53.015
'If my family loses, I lose too.'

01:22:56.393 --> 01:22:57.477
I won't let them lose.

01:23:01.565 --> 01:23:02.566
Let's see.

01:23:09.198 --> 01:23:10.908
What is it that you wanted
to talk personally earlier?

01:23:12.284 --> 01:23:14.494
What is personal? Take a step back.

01:23:16.830 --> 01:23:17.664
Back!

01:23:18.165 --> 01:23:19.750
-It was in the office, right?
-So?

01:23:19.917 --> 01:23:21.293
Did I try to bite you or what?

01:23:22.544 --> 01:23:23.670
In front of everyone...

01:23:26.465 --> 01:23:27.716
Being formal in the public

01:23:28.133 --> 01:23:29.676
and being casual in our personal
space would indeed be good.

01:23:31.220 --> 01:23:33.722
Why did you hide about
your MRO posting from me?

01:23:34.056 --> 01:23:35.349
It is not that I wanted to
hide that from you, Gumma.

01:23:36.225 --> 01:23:37.893
Do you know how huge
this responsibility is?

01:23:38.727 --> 01:23:41.104
Who will accompany me
other than you, in this task?

01:23:41.605 --> 01:23:42.439
What do you mean accompany?

01:23:43.440 --> 01:23:44.274
And for how long?

01:23:44.858 --> 01:23:47.236
There should be a time-frame, right?

01:23:50.572 --> 01:23:51.698
Life-long.

01:23:57.871 --> 01:24:00.123
[bike approaching]

01:24:00.207 --> 01:24:00.999
Mr Jagadish,

01:24:01.041 --> 01:24:02.376
your sister and brother-in-law are coming.

01:24:10.259 --> 01:24:11.051
Come fast.

01:24:11.677 --> 01:24:13.178
Brother, how are you doing?

01:24:13.345 --> 01:24:14.346
-Hey Jagadee
-Sit.

01:24:14.513 --> 01:24:15.430
How are you doing?

01:24:16.265 --> 01:24:18.809
Your sister made Dosas and 'Bombidai
Pulusu' (eel broth) for you.

01:24:19.059 --> 01:24:19.935
Bombidai pulusu (eel broth)?

01:24:20.143 --> 01:24:21.478
Not for you! It is for my brother.

01:24:21.728 --> 01:24:22.813
Is it all love?

01:24:24.940 --> 01:24:28.610
Jagadee, why are you staying here
as if you have no family members?

01:24:29.278 --> 01:24:31.613
-Let's go to our home.-Let's go.

01:24:32.531 --> 01:24:34.157
Home is where every
family member live together.

01:24:34.616 --> 01:24:36.743
Who is here, except cows and buffaloes?

01:24:39.580 --> 01:24:40.414
Father.

01:24:42.040 --> 01:24:44.459
It's okay, you became an MRO.

01:24:45.252 --> 01:24:46.962
We have our properties, right?

01:24:47.462 --> 01:24:48.297
How come?

01:24:48.797 --> 01:24:53.886
Bose got a stay order from the
court restricting our access to farms.

01:24:54.928 --> 01:24:56.305
Let's file a case against Bose.

01:24:56.555 --> 01:24:57.806
Let's do it! Yes!

01:24:59.099 --> 01:24:59.933
We will lose.

01:25:00.309 --> 01:25:02.686
Sister Kumari, you and Ram Bujjiah...

01:25:04.521 --> 01:25:06.523
We can win the case only if
three of you unite and file a case.

01:25:06.982 --> 01:25:08.817
How can we unite? How?

01:25:09.193 --> 01:25:11.486
Devudu berated me so badly here.

01:25:12.154 --> 01:25:13.405
Don't you remember?

01:25:14.239 --> 01:25:16.074
We too have self-respect.

01:25:16.408 --> 01:25:19.119
What would you do with
self-respect after losing properties?

01:25:19.244 --> 01:25:22.623
Ganga, consider me dead
if you join your sisters.

01:25:22.956 --> 01:25:26.126
My husband is healthy despite his
binge drinking. Ignore his words.

01:25:26.668 --> 01:25:29.505
Well, tell me what should I do?

01:25:34.968 --> 01:25:38.680
Your little brother made Bose to wait
for an hour outside the MRO's office.

01:25:38.972 --> 01:25:40.766
He doesn't do anything
without a reason.

01:25:40.849 --> 01:25:41.683
Sister...

01:25:42.184 --> 01:25:43.352
-Come, Jagadee
-My little brother...

01:25:46.730 --> 01:25:47.564
How are you doing?

01:25:47.731 --> 01:25:48.565
I'm good, Sister.

01:25:48.857 --> 01:25:50.567
Sai, I am looking gloomy, aren't I?

01:25:51.610 --> 01:25:53.946
I couldn't cry when needed.

01:25:54.112 --> 01:25:55.948
Think that you have lost your
property, you will automatically cry.

01:25:59.409 --> 01:26:00.577
What are they discussing?

01:26:00.786 --> 01:26:01.828
Didn't you say that you wouldn't
go inside unless they call you?

01:26:03.288 --> 01:26:04.331
Sister Ganga is waiting outside.

01:26:04.957 --> 01:26:06.792
She says that she won't come inside
unless your husband talks with her first.

01:26:12.381 --> 01:26:14.216
Brother-in-law Devudu, how are you doing?

01:26:14.967 --> 01:26:15.843
I'm doing fine.

01:26:18.846 --> 01:26:19.680
Sister...

01:26:24.017 --> 01:26:25.060
Talk to me.

01:26:27.938 --> 01:26:29.773
Why did you talk on the other
day by showing disparity?

01:26:30.732 --> 01:26:32.109
Don't you ever talk like that again.

01:26:34.653 --> 01:26:36.613
Sister Ganga is doing tremendous acting.

01:26:37.489 --> 01:26:38.490
That is not acting.

01:26:42.870 --> 01:26:47.708
Brother-in-law Devudu, Bose went to
court to restrict our access to our farms.

01:26:48.208 --> 01:26:49.710
Let's file a case against him.

01:26:50.043 --> 01:26:51.587
Jagadee will take care of it.

01:26:51.920 --> 01:26:53.255
-Court case?
-Yes.

01:26:53.922 --> 01:26:55.048
We'll be in trouble if your
mother comes to know about it.

01:26:55.257 --> 01:26:56.216
Jagadee!

01:26:56.550 --> 01:26:57.593
When did you come?

01:26:59.052 --> 01:26:59.887
Just now, Mother.

01:27:00.762 --> 01:27:01.889
Sister Ganga...

01:27:05.976 --> 01:27:09.980
Sister Ganga wants us to live together
regardless of losing the properties.

01:27:11.982 --> 01:27:12.816
Yes, Mother.

01:27:13.942 --> 01:27:17.654
I heard someone saying in the temple
that new M.R.O is a sincere guy.

01:27:19.865 --> 01:27:22.326
Your father would have been pleased.

01:27:27.497 --> 01:27:30.042
I heard that everyone got united
and filing a case against me.

01:27:31.210 --> 01:27:35.923
Let's see what Jagadee could
do... with all those women.

01:27:36.798 --> 01:27:38.050
I will give them hard time.

01:27:39.259 --> 01:27:40.969
I will give them hard
time till they exhaust.

01:27:41.970 --> 01:27:42.971
Nothing will happen, Bose.

01:27:44.139 --> 01:27:45.140
Your victory is inevitable.

01:27:47.809 --> 01:27:50.103
But if the farmers get
into the fields tomorrow,

01:27:51.021 --> 01:27:52.356
it will become an issue in the media.

01:27:55.108 --> 01:27:57.194
Somaraju's project would be scrapped.

01:27:59.863 --> 01:28:02.908
Your brother promised the farmers
that he'd take care of everything.

01:28:03.492 --> 01:28:04.326
What shall we do?

01:28:05.202 --> 01:28:07.454
No one should get into the fields.

01:28:08.789 --> 01:28:10.290
Even if he is my brother

01:28:12.292 --> 01:28:15.254
Intimidate him. If he doesn't obey,

01:28:19.258 --> 01:28:20.092
do whatever you want.

01:28:25.597 --> 01:28:26.807
Have dinner, Uncle.

01:28:31.395 --> 01:28:32.020
No.

01:28:32.062 --> 01:28:33.897
You knew all along about
his evil nature, don't you?

01:28:36.817 --> 01:28:39.695
You brought me up more
than my father did.

01:28:42.114 --> 01:28:43.949
Instead, you should have killed me.

01:29:00.299 --> 01:29:02.509
How dare you go against Mr. Veerendra?

01:29:02.676 --> 01:29:04.052
Leave the seedlings and go home.

01:29:04.344 --> 01:29:06.305
Else, there would be beheading.

01:29:06.513 --> 01:29:07.514
[baby crying]

01:29:10.058 --> 01:29:11.685
Why are you all staring dumbly?

01:29:11.894 --> 01:29:13.896
Should we be terrified
by his intimidation?

01:29:15.606 --> 01:29:16.690
-I'm going.
-Don't go, Maremma.

01:29:16.857 --> 01:29:18.108
-Take the kid.
-You'll die if you go.

01:29:18.192 --> 01:29:19.443
-It is okay if I die.
-Maremma!

01:29:19.610 --> 01:29:22.070
-It is better to die than live like this
-Please don't go.

01:29:22.154 --> 01:29:23.655
-Don't go.
-Maremma, come back.

01:29:26.491 --> 01:29:27.326
[groans]

01:29:27.492 --> 01:29:28.493
Maremma!

01:29:31.288 --> 01:29:33.624
Let go of me. Let go.

01:29:33.832 --> 01:29:36.084
If you have so much raging fire,
go and sleep with Veerendra.

01:29:37.669 --> 01:29:40.506
Exhibit your aggression there, not here.

01:30:00.859 --> 01:30:02.694
I have been observing you since childhood.

01:30:04.488 --> 01:30:08.158
I saw anger in your eyes,
miseries in your households

01:30:09.326 --> 01:30:11.078
and courage in your words.

01:30:12.162 --> 01:30:13.497
What is this fear, all of a sudden?

01:30:13.747 --> 01:30:14.998
Hey! Will you guys step in?

01:30:15.249 --> 01:30:17.584
I will clearly remember the face
of the first person who steps in.

01:30:19.419 --> 01:30:21.922
You might be skeptical about M.R.O's word.

01:30:22.214 --> 01:30:25.592
I, Tuck Jagadish, the youngest son of
Mr. Naidu/Bhudevipuram, telling you...

01:30:27.970 --> 01:30:28.929
Let the work begin.

01:30:29.638 --> 01:30:30.806
[baby crying]

01:30:52.578 --> 01:30:56.123
Oh blue drop of water

01:30:56.748 --> 01:31:00.460
You should keep raining so
that there be mild sunlight

01:31:09.261 --> 01:31:12.848
The sown saplings should grow straight

01:31:13.473 --> 01:31:17.227
If it grows into an abundant crop

01:31:17.728 --> 01:31:21.231
The landlord would give us
enough grain for a good life

01:31:21.815 --> 01:31:25.527
The Goddess would bless us well

01:31:25.944 --> 01:31:29.615
Who is the one who is a man
enough to cultivate the land?

01:31:30.073 --> 01:31:33.785
He is the son of the village head
and is quite a magnificent gentleman

01:31:42.669 --> 01:31:46.381
It's Lord Krishna's magic,
oh village damsel!

01:31:46.882 --> 01:31:50.552
The cobs stand and sway beautifully

01:31:51.053 --> 01:31:53.722
- After we toil and--
-Kill them all!

01:32:09.446 --> 01:32:10.447
Continue your work.

01:33:25.772 --> 01:33:26.523
Hey!

01:33:26.607 --> 01:33:29.359
You are charging at me by forgetting
the fact that your niece is at my home.

01:33:29.568 --> 01:33:30.402
That woman...

01:33:35.574 --> 01:33:36.742
[groans in pain]

01:33:37.701 --> 01:33:38.785
[groans in pain]

01:33:38.952 --> 01:33:41.914
This is for addressing
Chandramma indiscriminately.

01:33:42.956 --> 01:33:43.874
And you were about to say something else?

01:33:44.333 --> 01:33:45.209
Hey!

01:33:45.209 --> 01:33:46.043
Don't you dare say it.

01:33:47.127 --> 01:33:49.963
I will bury you in the land
bearing survey number: 136,

01:33:52.508 --> 01:33:53.675
burial ground.

01:33:55.677 --> 01:33:56.512
[groans in pain]

01:34:12.194 --> 01:34:13.946
You want to get to
the farmers of Bhudevipuram,

01:34:14.112 --> 01:34:15.781
you're gonna cross MRO Jagadish.

01:34:17.032 --> 01:34:18.659
You will be fine as long
you don't cross me.

01:34:19.952 --> 01:34:20.786
If you cross,

01:34:22.412 --> 01:34:23.497
I cannot guarantee on your safety.

01:34:31.046 --> 01:34:32.214
Have some food.

01:34:34.341 --> 01:34:35.175
Hey...
[plate clatters]

01:34:35.676 --> 01:34:36.552
-[groans in pain]
-Brother...

01:34:36.802 --> 01:34:37.719
Hey...

01:34:37.970 --> 01:34:38.804
-Hey...
-Hands off me.

01:34:41.306 --> 01:34:42.558
I want him dead.

01:34:43.475 --> 01:34:47.396
We should torture him to death.

01:34:49.773 --> 01:34:51.441
It's very painful!

01:34:56.446 --> 01:34:57.281
What's with you?

01:34:57.781 --> 01:34:59.116
Why would he get so enraged
when someone scolds you?

01:34:59.908 --> 01:35:02.119
-Let go of me.
-I will kill you and bury you right here!

01:35:02.286 --> 01:35:03.287
-Call him!
-Let go of him.

01:35:03.370 --> 01:35:04.371
Let's see who'd come here.

01:35:04.538 --> 01:35:05.706
What do you think of me?

01:35:05.956 --> 01:35:06.790
Are you playing with us?

01:35:06.999 --> 01:35:08.542
-Tiru, calm down!
-[grunts]

01:35:08.750 --> 01:35:09.751
Go inside.

01:35:11.378 --> 01:35:12.212
-Go.
-Damn you!

01:35:12.880 --> 01:35:13.714
Hey!

01:35:14.423 --> 01:35:15.340
Are you out of your mind?

01:35:15.757 --> 01:35:16.967
He chopped off Balireddy's hand.

01:35:17.259 --> 01:35:18.218
He has injured your brother's leg.

01:35:18.427 --> 01:35:19.761
And we don't know
what would he do with you?

01:35:20.095 --> 01:35:20.929
Do you need it?

01:35:21.096 --> 01:35:22.347
She is the lifeline for both of you.

01:35:22.764 --> 01:35:24.850
Both of you would be
alive only if she stays alive.

01:35:25.392 --> 01:35:28.061
Kill him and then, go for her.

01:35:32.900 --> 01:35:33.859
-Mr David
-Yes, sir.

01:35:34.276 --> 01:35:36.528
Conduct resurvey and fix
all the boundary issues.

01:35:36.945 --> 01:35:37.821
Okay, sir.

01:35:37.821 --> 01:35:39.364
-Issue passbooks within ten days.
-Okay, sir.

01:35:39.531 --> 01:35:41.325
The passbooks are supposed
to come from Chennai, sir.

01:35:41.533 --> 01:35:43.911
It takes up to one month if we apply now.

01:35:48.040 --> 01:35:50.417
It takes one month each for Chennai
works, surveyor works, VRO works

01:35:50.584 --> 01:35:51.418
and MRO works to finish.

01:35:51.919 --> 01:35:52.753
It might even take some years.

01:35:53.128 --> 01:35:56.965
A generation would change by the
time we issue a passbook to a farmer.

01:35:58.926 --> 01:36:02.137
Go and apply directly instead
of applying through postal service.

01:36:02.471 --> 01:36:03.764
Catch the Chennai bound bus tonight.

01:36:04.097 --> 01:36:04.932
Okay, sir.

01:36:30.749 --> 01:36:32.751
I want to talk to you personally.

01:36:33.460 --> 01:36:35.921
She's gonna stay. Tell me.

01:36:39.007 --> 01:36:40.968
My name is Gali Somaraju.

01:36:42.469 --> 01:36:44.763
I have come here to discuss
about a project with you.

01:36:46.598 --> 01:36:48.892
I heard that you declined
to sign on the NOC for your brother.

01:36:49.142 --> 01:36:50.143
I will do the same for you as well.

01:36:50.561 --> 01:36:51.854
Arrogant!

01:36:52.396 --> 01:36:54.231
I heard that people
call you Tuck Jagadish.

01:36:55.649 --> 01:36:57.568
Well, my PA too tucks in his shirt.

01:36:58.610 --> 01:37:00.779
What's with your greatness?

01:37:13.625 --> 01:37:15.627
I was eight years old, Mr Somaraju.

01:37:17.671 --> 01:37:20.132
I was returning home
from the school in the rain.

01:37:22.301 --> 01:37:24.845
A white coloured Ambassador
car stopped beside me.

01:37:28.223 --> 01:37:31.852
I saw a gentleman in the
car who tucked in his shirt.

01:37:34.271 --> 01:37:36.732
He offered me to drop
at home and took me in his car.

01:37:38.108 --> 01:37:41.945
That gentleman talked to several
people while I was in the car.

01:37:44.323 --> 01:37:47.618
He gave money to ones who needed
it, courage to some others

01:37:48.660 --> 01:37:50.370
and he warned some people too.

01:37:52.789 --> 01:37:54.541
But everyone greeted him with respect.

01:37:57.211 --> 01:37:59.087
I asked my father as
soon as I reached home,

01:38:00.422 --> 01:38:03.175
Who is that gentleman so many people
are paying such huge respect to, Father?

01:38:06.845 --> 01:38:12.059
My father replied, "He is a very
good-natured government officer".

01:38:14.478 --> 01:38:15.896
I have decided on that day to

01:38:17.314 --> 01:38:21.485
tuck in, offer courage...

01:38:23.779 --> 01:38:25.697
and warn like him.

01:38:29.201 --> 01:38:30.369
If someone doesn't obey,

01:38:31.870 --> 01:38:33.705
we have to break his bone
regardless of who he is.

01:38:45.300 --> 01:38:46.093
Somaraju!

01:38:48.804 --> 01:38:50.305
Your car shouldn't turn around.

01:38:58.939 --> 01:39:02.359
The chair is the property of government.

01:39:02.651 --> 01:39:03.735
Who will bear the charges?

01:39:05.362 --> 01:39:06.488
File it in my account.

01:39:08.156 --> 01:39:10.450
Let's go. We shall have a
delicious non-vegetarian meal.

01:39:10.784 --> 01:39:12.411
-Is it?
-Hmm.

01:39:20.752 --> 01:39:21.753
Greetings, sir.

01:39:22.504 --> 01:39:25.257
Please be careful while
dealing with my brothers, sir.

01:39:32.097 --> 01:39:33.098
Welcome, Mr MRO.

01:39:33.348 --> 01:39:35.100
Heard that you wanted
to resolve over a meal.

01:39:35.350 --> 01:39:36.643
Venkat Rao informed me.

01:39:42.357 --> 01:39:43.192
Sit down.

01:39:53.160 --> 01:39:56.163
I'm the eldest brother.
Decide after considering everything.

01:39:56.830 --> 01:39:57.998
Else,

01:39:58.916 --> 01:40:00.292
the head...

01:40:02.336 --> 01:40:03.545
Try mutton head curry.

01:40:05.005 --> 01:40:06.882
Age shouldn't be taken into consideration
while dividing the properties.

01:40:07.132 --> 01:40:08.675
If I don't get what I deserve,
I will not let anyone leave.

01:40:08.842 --> 01:40:10.552
My husband died in that
plantation's dispute.

01:40:10.677 --> 01:40:11.720
I won't compromise either.

01:40:11.970 --> 01:40:12.638
I'll rip your intestines out and

01:40:12.679 --> 01:40:14.056
put them around my husband's
photo frame like a garland.

01:40:21.021 --> 01:40:22.231
[coughs]

01:40:22.397 --> 01:40:23.607
[chuckles]

01:40:24.233 --> 01:40:27.110
One can expect a spicy meal
at Kankarla's home.

01:40:27.569 --> 01:40:28.612
Have some water.

01:40:29.071 --> 01:40:29.988
Can I get an onion?

01:40:31.323 --> 01:40:32.282
Onion?

01:40:33.158 --> 01:40:33.992
It is right here.

01:40:52.386 --> 01:40:54.596
Assume that this is the 8 acres of land
which your father gave to your family.

01:40:55.931 --> 01:40:57.516
The eldest one gets two acres.

01:40:59.268 --> 01:41:00.978
The second one gets two acres

01:41:02.729 --> 01:41:04.982
The third one gets two acres.

01:41:05.649 --> 01:41:06.984
You've sliced my share
into a very little size.

01:41:07.276 --> 01:41:09.653
This is just an onion.
I am using it as an example.

01:41:11.280 --> 01:41:13.156
Venkat Rao, this is your two acres.

01:41:14.700 --> 01:41:15.701
This is the last piece,

01:41:15.993 --> 01:41:17.911
the half-acre of land which your
father had given it to your mother.

01:41:19.746 --> 01:41:21.373
Instead of cultivating in those
eight acres of land, you've been

01:41:21.582 --> 01:41:26.712
fighting over a half-acre of land for
six years and letting no one use it.

01:41:29.631 --> 01:41:30.799
Where is your nuptial chain?

01:41:30.966 --> 01:41:32.301
We sold it to pay up
the court expenses.

01:41:32.551 --> 01:41:33.969
Who the hell asked
you to approach court?

01:41:34.052 --> 01:41:35.554
Your bloody life!

01:41:37.139 --> 01:41:38.307
Why are you grinding your teeth?

01:41:38.432 --> 01:41:41.476
My father asked me to grind my teeth
whenever I come across my cousins.

01:41:46.023 --> 01:41:46.857
What are you studying?

01:41:47.107 --> 01:41:49.193
No studies until these
disputes are resolved, sir.

01:41:49.234 --> 01:41:50.360
We just need what we deserve.

01:41:50.736 --> 01:41:51.570
I won't let you have it even
if it takes losing my life.

01:41:51.737 --> 01:41:52.863
Why so?

01:41:53.071 --> 01:41:55.490
You are a widow and have no kids.
Why do you need property?

01:41:55.574 --> 01:41:58.202
I will bear kids from whoever I want.
That's no concern of yours.

01:41:58.285 --> 01:41:59.203
Hit you with footwear!

01:41:59.411 --> 01:42:00.370
Bloody cowards!

01:42:00.579 --> 01:42:02.581
What the hell are you
blabbering. I will hack you!

01:42:02.748 --> 01:42:03.624
[sickle clangs]
Hack, my foot!

01:42:03.790 --> 01:42:06.585
I dare you lay your hand on me! I will
smash your head with a rice-pounder!

01:42:06.793 --> 01:42:11.423
[overlap of voices]
[sickle clang continues]

01:42:12.674 --> 01:42:13.967
[overlap of voices]

01:42:17.179 --> 01:42:18.764
Do you have any sense?

01:42:18.972 --> 01:42:20.766
There used to be a word around that
one has to look up to Kankarla's family

01:42:21.016 --> 01:42:22.184
when it comes to farming.

01:42:23.644 --> 01:42:24.895
But you have put aside
farming and left the fields to dry,

01:42:25.062 --> 01:42:27.397
women with no ornaments
and kids with no education.

01:42:31.193 --> 01:42:33.529
If four of you had cultivated
some crops in these past six years,

01:42:33.862 --> 01:42:37.449
you would have harvested 2000 bags
of paddy in those eight acres of land.

01:42:38.659 --> 01:42:40.577
After all the expenses,

01:42:41.995 --> 01:42:43.956
each of you would have
earned 8 lakh rupees.

01:42:45.249 --> 01:42:46.834
It would have
benefited your children's future.

01:42:48.377 --> 01:42:49.294
Instead,

01:42:50.963 --> 01:42:53.215
you are sowing the seeds of revenge
and discord in the hearts of the kids.

01:42:56.176 --> 01:42:59.555
Did you forget your blood relations
after getting married and having kids?

01:43:03.684 --> 01:43:05.894
You might give some extra property to
your kids by gaining from these disputes.

01:43:05.936 --> 01:43:07.271
But what if something terrible happens?

01:43:08.564 --> 01:43:09.606
What if someone among you dies?

01:43:11.024 --> 01:43:12.442
Can you give them courage by stating,

01:43:12.568 --> 01:43:14.319
It's alright, my brothers
will take care of my kids.

01:43:19.241 --> 01:43:21.994
If anyone in your family fails, then
it's a failure of your entire family.

01:43:24.621 --> 01:43:25.664
It's been too late.

01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:29.877
Consider the future of
of your kids and take a decision.

01:44:10.626 --> 01:44:12.377
[grunting]

01:44:19.551 --> 01:44:23.472
Crossing the boundaries of greed

01:44:23.972 --> 01:44:28.268
You have to evolve as a universal human

01:44:33.857 --> 01:44:37.694
Crossing the boundaries of greed

01:44:38.237 --> 01:44:42.574
You have to evolve as a universal human

01:44:42.824 --> 01:44:47.287
Let the seeds sprout up
clearing the weeds

01:44:47.621 --> 01:44:52.584
Bond of love should make
you overcome differences

01:44:54.461 --> 01:44:59.842
Witness the bliss of
the growing saplings

01:45:01.468 --> 01:45:06.640
The wind from the crop soothes your toil

01:45:07.140 --> 01:45:11.395
You are the relative we never had,
you taught us love

01:45:11.728 --> 01:45:16.191
You are the one who taught us to be kind

01:45:16.400 --> 01:45:21.029
You are the one who helped
us to change our destiny

01:45:21.280 --> 01:45:25.617
Your tale would be an example
for the future generations

01:45:35.669 --> 01:45:37.379
He warned all the contractors.

01:45:37.546 --> 01:45:38.881
No one is paying heed to us.

01:45:39.882 --> 01:45:40.716
[groans in anger]

01:45:41.842 --> 01:45:43.385
Chittemma is not believing us, sir.

01:45:44.052 --> 01:45:46.138
They claim that my husband is dead, sir.

01:45:46.346 --> 01:45:48.724
He will return for me
and for our kid for sure.

01:45:49.057 --> 01:45:50.225
He promised me.

01:45:51.018 --> 01:45:53.270
-I will demand Veerendra--
-Your husband is no more.

01:45:56.064 --> 01:45:57.107
He was killed.

01:46:03.447 --> 01:46:04.948
But you have this brother with you.

01:46:05.490 --> 01:46:09.953
You are the relative we never had
You taught us to be together

01:46:10.370 --> 01:46:14.833
You are the one who taught us to be kind

01:46:15.125 --> 01:46:19.546
You are the one who helped
us to change our destiny

01:46:19.880 --> 01:46:24.218
Your tale would be an example
for the future generations

01:46:24.593 --> 01:46:28.430
Crossing the boundaries of greed

01:46:28.972 --> 01:46:33.143
-You have to evolve as a universal human
- It's tasty.

01:47:12.140 --> 01:47:16.520
I've approached the darkness
to win over you

01:47:16.854 --> 01:47:21.191
I've stored my sorrow to show you

01:47:21.692 --> 01:47:25.821
I will keep my word

01:47:26.238 --> 01:47:30.242
and protect you always

01:47:30.576 --> 01:47:34.955
Would you be able to buy
back a lost bonding?

01:47:35.414 --> 01:47:37.457
Your steps could falter

01:47:37.791 --> 01:47:40.669
- But I'd be with you till you're stable
-Hello. Hello?

01:47:41.503 --> 01:47:42.629
Who is it?

01:47:42.838 --> 01:47:47.009
Every foundation has good and evil

01:47:49.303 --> 01:47:54.349
Forgiving makes you
the greatest of humans

01:47:54.975 --> 01:47:59.313
You are the relative we never had,
you taught us love

01:47:59.646 --> 01:48:04.067
You are the one who taught us to be kind

01:48:04.401 --> 01:48:08.780
You are the one who helped
us to change our destiny

01:48:09.114 --> 01:48:13.577
Your tale would be an example
for the future generations

01:48:33.222 --> 01:48:37.559
[bells ringing]
[chanting]

01:48:38.936 --> 01:48:40.187
[temple bell ringing]
[priest chanting]

01:48:44.274 --> 01:48:45.317
Bose?

01:48:45.943 --> 01:48:47.486
[groaning]

01:48:49.404 --> 01:48:50.614
Granny!

01:48:52.157 --> 01:48:53.867
-How are you?
-I'm fine.

01:48:58.830 --> 01:49:00.541
-Come.
-I want to be with Granny.

01:49:00.707 --> 01:49:02.084
-Come!
-I want to be with Granny.

01:49:02.334 --> 01:49:03.168
Come now!

01:49:03.377 --> 01:49:05.045
Granny! Granny!

01:49:10.384 --> 01:49:12.719
Dear, she is running a high temperature.

01:49:13.762 --> 01:49:16.557
Granny... Granny...

01:49:16.932 --> 01:49:17.558
Nithu?

01:49:17.599 --> 01:49:20.602
After seeing your mother
in temple, she fell ill.

01:49:20.894 --> 01:49:23.146
If we can take her to your mother--

01:49:23.313 --> 01:49:24.731
She is not my mother!

01:49:24.940 --> 01:49:25.983
[gasps in fear]

01:49:26.233 --> 01:49:27.818
I have already told you many times.

01:49:28.151 --> 01:49:28.986
Bhadram?

01:49:29.152 --> 01:49:30.195
Coming, sir.

01:49:30.821 --> 01:49:32.030
Mr. Bose Babu!

01:49:32.364 --> 01:49:34.533
We have to take the kid
to Bhushan, get the vehicle ready.

01:49:34.783 --> 01:49:36.326
That doctor has turned arrogant.

01:49:36.660 --> 01:49:37.995
He is not treating after 9 pm.

01:49:38.203 --> 01:49:39.538
-Then, let's get him here.
-OK.

01:49:49.423 --> 01:49:50.299
Jagadee...

01:49:51.300 --> 01:49:52.467
How is the child?

01:49:52.968 --> 01:49:54.052
Granny!

01:49:54.261 --> 01:49:56.930
I felt the temperature
when I held her at the temple.

01:49:57.222 --> 01:49:58.307
Oh, my baby!

01:50:04.188 --> 01:50:06.523
Why aren't you staying with us, Uncle?

01:50:20.287 --> 01:50:22.623
Since you are playing with us a lot...

01:50:23.248 --> 01:50:24.875
And ignoring homework.

01:50:25.626 --> 01:50:27.461
So Dad wanted us to stay away.

01:50:30.797 --> 01:50:34.343
If you study well, we all will come here.

01:50:36.428 --> 01:50:37.971
Will you study well?

01:50:44.561 --> 01:50:45.812
You are alright now!

01:50:46.897 --> 01:50:48.065
What will you tell Dad now?

01:50:49.066 --> 01:50:51.568
I will tell him that my fever
disappeared as granny visited.

01:50:51.860 --> 01:50:54.947
That would make him angry and
he would join you in a hostel.

01:51:18.220 --> 01:51:19.054
Mom.

01:51:24.351 --> 01:51:25.394
Have dinner, son.

01:51:25.769 --> 01:51:27.688
I have a small work,
I will be right back.

01:51:27.855 --> 01:51:28.856
Have dinner and go to bed.

01:51:30.107 --> 01:51:31.191
Be careful.

01:51:37.823 --> 01:51:39.324
Where are we going?

01:51:49.209 --> 01:51:50.043
Have the beer.

01:51:50.711 --> 01:51:51.670
Do you booze?

01:51:52.588 --> 01:51:53.922
Shouldn't MROs booze?

01:51:54.256 --> 01:51:55.591
I didn't mean that.

01:52:15.652 --> 01:52:16.778
Gumma.

01:52:18.280 --> 01:52:20.490
Once we send a girl from
our family to another...

01:52:21.617 --> 01:52:23.911
If we come to know that
she is going through hell...

01:52:26.997 --> 01:52:28.749
Do you know how painful that is?

01:52:30.709 --> 01:52:32.753
She destroyed her life
due to her anger on me.

01:52:36.924 --> 01:52:40.886
If she turns the light on once,
he'd bring her back in a jiffy.

01:52:41.637 --> 01:52:43.430
But Chandramma doesn't understand.

01:52:43.889 --> 01:52:46.725
The court play was only
to unite both his sisters.

01:52:47.017 --> 01:52:48.310
He can't lose anyone.

01:52:48.977 --> 01:52:50.854
We have seen people obsessed
with money and caste...

01:52:51.146 --> 01:52:52.606
But he is obsessed with his family.

01:52:57.569 --> 01:52:59.655
I like her so much.

01:53:00.822 --> 01:53:01.990
Jagadee.

01:53:05.911 --> 01:53:06.787
Crazy girl

01:53:07.246 --> 01:53:08.121
[groaning]

01:53:08.914 --> 01:53:09.957
What is he saying?

01:53:10.457 --> 01:53:14.503
Uncle Bose used to snatch snacks
from Uncle Bujji in their childhood.

01:53:14.753 --> 01:53:16.171
He says he will say the same
in the court tomorrow

01:53:16.463 --> 01:53:18.173
It's not about snacks,
you stupid!

01:53:18.799 --> 01:53:21.343
Say that he grabbed our properties
and drove us out.

01:53:21.593 --> 01:53:23.011
Not just the properties, Ganga!

01:53:23.178 --> 01:53:24.680
The 5 lakhs he promised
for the fertilizer shop.

01:53:24.930 --> 01:53:26.473
We have to get that from Bose.

01:53:26.682 --> 01:53:28.016
Shouldn't we get that too!

01:53:29.017 --> 01:53:32.145
You will get married to her
only if we win the case over Bose.

01:53:32.312 --> 01:53:33.188
Mind it.

01:53:33.188 --> 01:53:34.565
-You are the witness, sis--
-Ganga!

01:53:39.903 --> 01:53:41.280
You're about to sue Bose?

01:53:44.116 --> 01:53:45.826
Devudu, what is happening here?

01:53:45.993 --> 01:53:47.244
Even I don't like it.

01:53:48.245 --> 01:53:49.788
Jagadee said...

01:53:49.997 --> 01:53:52.833
How can we stay quiet when the women
in our family are being cheated

01:53:53.166 --> 01:53:55.294
-So we have to sue Bose--
-Stop it now.

01:53:55.502 --> 01:53:56.712
Where is Jagadee?

01:53:57.004 --> 01:53:58.463
-He is inside.
-Brother-in-law!

01:53:58.964 --> 01:54:00.716
I ate at Chandra's home last night.

01:54:01.216 --> 01:54:02.509
She insisted.

01:54:03.844 --> 01:54:06.138
Did you suggest them to sue Bose?

01:54:10.684 --> 01:54:11.518
Well, Mom...

01:54:11.894 --> 01:54:13.061
Did you tell them or not?

01:54:14.771 --> 01:54:17.399
So you've grown big enough
to divide the property?

01:54:17.524 --> 01:54:19.651
Everything will fall in place
once Bose changes his mind.

01:54:19.818 --> 01:54:21.987
Why are you compromising
family's honour for that?

01:54:22.571 --> 01:54:23.947
Listen to my words carefully.

01:54:24.156 --> 01:54:27.993
If anyone wants to go
to Court against Bose!

01:54:28.160 --> 01:54:29.286
It's like going against me.

01:54:31.371 --> 01:54:32.456
Promise me.

01:54:43.509 --> 01:54:45.594
You promised me before you did to Mother.

01:54:45.761 --> 01:54:46.929
Don't go back on it, Bro.

01:54:49.515 --> 01:54:50.599
Have it

01:54:53.060 --> 01:54:55.729
[mobile ringing]

01:54:59.608 --> 01:55:00.526
Hello.

01:55:20.462 --> 01:55:21.588
I will meet you later.

01:55:22.297 --> 01:55:23.298
Jagadee

01:55:23.632 --> 01:55:25.217
Where did you disappear, Mr. Murthy?

01:55:25.551 --> 01:55:26.760
We need to talk.

01:55:29.972 --> 01:55:31.807
You missed Father's funeral too.

01:55:32.641 --> 01:55:33.767
Be seated.

01:55:39.022 --> 01:55:40.357
It's your brother behind everything.

01:55:41.275 --> 01:55:42.651
When your Father passed away,

01:55:42.860 --> 01:55:46.029
I ran away like a coward
without lending a helping hand.

01:55:47.739 --> 01:55:49.157
I came to know just yesterday...

01:55:49.741 --> 01:55:52.870
That Bose has got a stay that
no one can claim any property.

01:55:53.287 --> 01:55:56.748
According to him, the entire property
belongs to your mother Tulasamma.

01:55:57.040 --> 01:55:58.750
But Bose isn't the heir for it.

01:55:58.917 --> 01:55:59.960
It's you.

01:56:01.253 --> 01:56:02.296
That's true Jagadee.

01:56:02.504 --> 01:56:04.131
Bose isn't your own brother.

01:56:04.673 --> 01:56:06.133
He was born to Arjunamma.

01:56:09.303 --> 01:56:12.931
When your mother had lost two
children at birth and was down mentally,

01:56:13.348 --> 01:56:17.144
Arjunamma showed kindness and
gave her son Bose to Tulasamma.

01:56:17.352 --> 01:56:19.188
Later, Tulasamma gave birth to you.

01:56:19.396 --> 01:56:21.732
She did give away her son,
but not her love on him.

01:56:22.566 --> 01:56:26.195
Hence, Arjunamma is stopping
you all from suing Bose.

01:56:26.695 --> 01:56:28.447
Only when you get the entire property,

01:56:28.739 --> 01:56:30.866
would your father's final
wish would be fulfilled.

01:56:31.033 --> 01:56:32.910
When I inquired your
maternal Uncle who resides in UK,

01:56:33.118 --> 01:56:34.786
He said we could get hold
of the original documents

01:56:34.995 --> 01:56:36.997
-Then we could teach Bose a lesso--
-Mr. Murthy.

01:56:40.292 --> 01:56:41.335
Don't reveal this to anyone.

01:56:41.543 --> 01:56:43.545
-But Jagadee...
-I take it as a word from you.

01:56:46.465 --> 01:56:47.466
Jagadee...

01:56:55.807 --> 01:56:57.768
Mother, didn't you sleep yet?

01:56:58.560 --> 01:57:00.395
I was waiting for Bose.

01:57:01.438 --> 01:57:02.898
He might fall asleep without having food.

01:57:05.817 --> 01:57:09.947
You'll say it yourself that Bose
has got a very good match.

01:57:12.449 --> 01:57:13.492
Promise me.

01:57:23.544 --> 01:57:26.547
Sir, the farmers from Kondapalem
are here to meet you.

01:57:26.755 --> 01:57:28.257
-Send them in.
-Alright sir.

01:57:28.590 --> 01:57:31.260
[mobile ringing]

01:57:36.682 --> 01:57:37.683
What is it, Jadagee?

01:57:38.392 --> 01:57:39.810
I've heard you're not suing me.

01:57:40.435 --> 01:57:41.728
Are you scared?

01:57:42.479 --> 01:57:46.066
I wanted to see that wretched woman
and her daughters approach the court.

01:57:46.817 --> 01:57:48.485
You didn't give me the chance to.

01:57:49.194 --> 01:57:54.992
One more word about mother and
I'll forget that you are my brother.

01:58:02.499 --> 01:58:03.792
Yeah, Mr. Somaraju.

01:58:04.585 --> 01:58:06.086
I'm just onto getting the NOC.

01:58:06.295 --> 01:58:07.796
Let's start our work once I get it.

01:58:07.963 --> 01:58:10.799
That's not possible until your brother
is sitting on the MRO's chair.

01:58:10.966 --> 01:58:12.759
-But listen--
-I'm stalling the project.

01:58:13.302 --> 01:58:16.054
Return the advance of five crores
I sent you immediately.

01:58:16.430 --> 01:58:17.723
Five crores?

01:58:18.307 --> 01:58:19.641
When did you give that and to whom?

01:58:19.808 --> 01:58:21.351
Are you playing with me?

01:58:21.602 --> 01:58:24.188
Veerendra took five crores
from me claiming it's your share.

01:58:24.646 --> 01:58:26.023
You both figure that out.

01:58:26.481 --> 01:58:29.026
But I need that money by tomorrow.

01:58:29.067 --> 01:58:30.527
Else I'd sue you for cheating.

01:58:34.323 --> 01:58:35.157
Bose.

01:58:35.199 --> 01:58:37.284
Did you take 5 crores
from Somaraju on my name?

01:58:37.743 --> 01:58:39.453
Yes, I did.

01:58:40.037 --> 01:58:41.371
I wanted to give it to you
if we bagged the project.

01:58:41.914 --> 01:58:42.748
But we didn't!

01:58:42.915 --> 01:58:44.208
Trying to back-stab me?

01:58:44.416 --> 01:58:45.792
What was it that you did, then?

01:58:46.001 --> 01:58:48.337
Didn't you sell a girl from your
family to us for this deal?

01:58:48.504 --> 01:58:49.588
Bose...

01:58:49.838 --> 01:58:51.590
You have no right to talk
about backstabbing.

01:58:51.965 --> 01:58:53.300
Be right there!

01:58:53.759 --> 01:58:54.843
I'm coming for you.

01:58:59.473 --> 01:59:00.307
Hey!

01:59:13.403 --> 01:59:14.446
Sister-in-law...

01:59:15.197 --> 01:59:16.782
Jagadee, I'm so tense.

01:59:16.949 --> 01:59:18.450
It's been long since they took him inside.

01:59:18.992 --> 01:59:23.121
Dad was covered in blood, Uncle.
Mom has been crying since then.

01:59:25.916 --> 01:59:28.168
There is internal bleeding.
He needs a surgery immediately.

01:59:28.335 --> 01:59:30.295
We need O negative blood
please arrange it quickly.

01:59:30.504 --> 01:59:31.880
-Anything serious?
-Nothing to worry.

01:59:32.130 --> 01:59:34.550
My blood group is same as his, Doctor.
I will donate

01:59:35.676 --> 01:59:36.635
Come along.

01:59:36.844 --> 01:59:37.845
Mother in law!

02:00:13.088 --> 02:00:13.922
Jagadee...

02:00:14.089 --> 02:00:16.425
He regained consciousness.
Go and meet him.

02:00:22.014 --> 02:00:24.391
[machine blips]

02:00:29.771 --> 02:00:31.607
I trusted Veerendra with Chandra...

02:00:32.316 --> 02:00:33.775
If mother hadn't donated blood on time...

02:00:35.194 --> 02:00:36.278
She isn't our mom.

02:00:37.446 --> 02:00:40.991
I don't want this life if it was
saved because of her mercy.

02:00:41.366 --> 02:00:43.702
-She is always an outsider for me.
-It's me who is an outsider.

02:00:46.872 --> 02:00:47.998
She gave birth to you.

02:00:49.833 --> 02:00:52.294
You were born out of her womb.

02:01:00.260 --> 02:01:01.303
Is it true?

02:01:01.762 --> 02:01:02.971
When did you realise the truth?

02:01:04.806 --> 02:01:06.642
Did you ever treat her like your mother?

02:01:09.770 --> 02:01:11.021
At least like a human?

02:01:13.190 --> 02:01:14.691
She eats only after you do.

02:01:15.651 --> 02:01:16.860
And sleeps after you do.

02:01:18.695 --> 02:01:22.241
She made me take an oath on her life
if I approach the court against you.

02:01:24.910 --> 02:01:26.578
She will die if something happens to you.

02:01:30.541 --> 02:01:31.792
And what you did to her...

02:01:32.459 --> 02:01:34.086
But I never considered you as a mother.

02:01:35.462 --> 02:01:36.755
We are not blood-related.

02:01:43.804 --> 02:01:44.847
I want to see her.

02:01:47.015 --> 02:01:50.477
She can't tolerate it if you go
as if you realized the truth.

02:01:52.145 --> 02:01:53.522
Meet her as a changed Bose.

02:01:54.731 --> 02:01:56.942
That joy would make her live longer.

02:02:02.447 --> 02:02:03.448
Brother,

02:02:04.408 --> 02:02:07.452
Don't let anyone in our family know
that I am not your own brother.

02:02:09.997 --> 02:02:12.165
Otherwise, I will become an outsider.

02:02:13.625 --> 02:02:14.668
Hey!

02:02:17.671 --> 02:02:18.839
You are my brother!

02:02:20.048 --> 02:02:21.008
My own one.

02:02:32.394 --> 02:02:33.437
Granny!

02:02:33.770 --> 02:02:35.022
-Nithu!
-Dad is here!

02:02:54.374 --> 02:02:57.377
Even animals would be
loyal if we feed them.

02:02:58.086 --> 02:03:01.423
But I never treated you at least
like a human even after you raised me!

02:03:03.717 --> 02:03:05.552
Though I hated you...

02:03:08.180 --> 02:03:09.723
You saved my life.

02:03:11.391 --> 02:03:14.978
I'm not even worthy
to ask for forgiveness, Arjunamma.

02:03:25.113 --> 02:03:27.824
Bose, you are more than my own son.

02:03:46.051 --> 02:03:47.386
[thunders rumbling]

02:03:49.304 --> 02:03:51.765
I felt your wrath in real, Ganga!

02:03:55.143 --> 02:03:56.311
Bose.

02:03:57.813 --> 02:03:59.481
Don't cry, Dad.

02:03:59.690 --> 02:04:02.317
[weeping]

02:04:13.245 --> 02:04:14.705
I wanted to betray you.

02:04:15.622 --> 02:04:18.375
Please forgive me.

02:04:18.584 --> 02:04:19.793
-Don't act like a kid now.
-Forgive me.

02:04:22.921 --> 02:04:25.090
Come, let's go to our home.

02:04:27.259 --> 02:04:28.343
Jagadish, sir.

02:04:29.303 --> 02:04:30.262
Take cover.

02:04:31.305 --> 02:04:32.848
Your brother Bose is at home.

02:04:33.015 --> 02:04:34.683
Your mother's happiness has no limits.

02:04:34.850 --> 02:04:35.726
-Is it?
-Yeah.

02:04:35.976 --> 02:04:37.352
I will go turn off the engine.

02:04:40.063 --> 02:04:41.481
I know you Bose.

02:04:41.732 --> 02:04:44.276
You cannot hide your emotions.

02:04:47.946 --> 02:04:49.740
You are not stubborn as the younger one.

02:04:50.574 --> 02:04:53.076
He assumes he can buy people with money.

02:04:53.744 --> 02:04:55.829
Why will he file a case
against his own brother?

02:04:56.246 --> 02:04:57.080
Don't say that, Mother.

02:04:57.247 --> 02:04:58.790
His evil eye is responsible
for your accident.

02:04:58.999 --> 02:05:00.834
-He united us--
-You are my life.

02:05:11.887 --> 02:05:13.972
Why are you leaving so soon?
Take the keys.

02:05:15.974 --> 02:05:17.726
Can't you see the calf is crying?

02:05:20.062 --> 02:05:21.271
Why did you leave it in the rain?

02:05:23.440 --> 02:05:25.234
-Take it into the shed
-I will do that.

02:05:28.237 --> 02:05:29.947
-Give me the keys
-I already did, sir.

02:05:33.659 --> 02:05:34.535
Oh, you did!

02:06:16.910 --> 02:06:17.995
Jagadee...

02:06:24.960 --> 02:06:26.086
What happened Jagadee?

02:06:28.255 --> 02:06:29.298
Well it's nothing.

02:06:31.133 --> 02:06:32.259
Just like that!

02:06:32.467 --> 02:06:33.427
Tell me what is it?

02:06:34.970 --> 02:06:36.096
Gumma.

02:06:38.807 --> 02:06:39.975
How do I look?

02:06:42.102 --> 02:06:43.187
I mean...

02:06:46.023 --> 02:06:47.482
My behaviour.

02:06:50.360 --> 02:06:51.403
You look good.

02:06:55.032 --> 02:06:55.866
It's not that.

02:07:02.414 --> 02:07:04.416
Do I look as if I don't
have any feelings?

02:07:09.463 --> 02:07:10.797
Do I look stubborn?

02:07:13.592 --> 02:07:15.511
That is for people who judge you by looks.

02:07:18.597 --> 02:07:21.934
To the people who cannot understand
what you are inside.

02:07:24.478 --> 02:07:26.188
How long will you
endure alone, MRO?

02:07:33.028 --> 02:07:34.238
Let me share it too.

02:07:57.344 --> 02:07:58.554
I told you back then.

02:07:58.887 --> 02:08:00.722
That family is not right for my sister.

02:08:01.181 --> 02:08:04.351
-If my nephew doesn't get his property...
-Whom are you here for, sir?

02:08:04.560 --> 02:08:06.854
I will make sure,
Arjunamma's family pays for it.

02:08:07.020 --> 02:08:08.939
I was born in Bhudevipuram too.

02:08:09.606 --> 02:08:10.691
Who are you, sir?

02:08:10.941 --> 02:08:12.150
I'm your maternal uncle.

02:08:12.401 --> 02:08:13.402
I'm Tulasamma's brother.

02:08:15.487 --> 02:08:16.989
Don't you worry Jagadee...

02:08:17.239 --> 02:08:20.993
I'm here to teach them a lesson
and get you back your property.

02:08:24.371 --> 02:08:28.375
You left your sister years ago
as she married against your will.

02:08:29.209 --> 02:08:30.669
You didn't even attend her funeral.

02:08:31.253 --> 02:08:32.838
Now, you showed up to divide the property?

02:08:33.046 --> 02:08:35.924
You got it wrong, son.
It all belongs to your mother Tulasamma.

02:08:37.551 --> 02:08:38.719
My mother's name is Arjunamma, sir.

02:08:39.219 --> 02:08:40.512
Bose Babu and Ram Bujji are my brothers.

02:08:40.929 --> 02:08:42.181
I have two sisters too.

02:08:42.389 --> 02:08:44.349
Don't distance them from me
in the name of properties.

02:08:47.436 --> 02:08:48.812
I am not related to you in anyway.

02:08:49.563 --> 02:08:50.397
You can leave.

02:08:50.647 --> 02:08:51.481
Hello...

02:08:52.566 --> 02:08:54.943
Mr. Pathrudu, our notices are delivered.

02:08:57.029 --> 02:09:01.533
Your uncle sent notices to Arjunamma's
family regarding the property.

02:09:11.418 --> 02:09:12.252
Uncle!

02:09:14.463 --> 02:09:15.589
What are these notices?

02:09:16.215 --> 02:09:18.217
-Brother-in-law, it was the lawyer--
-Did you meet your uncle?

02:09:18.467 --> 02:09:20.469
-Yes I did but--
-Did you meet him?

02:09:21.470 --> 02:09:22.387
Did you meet him or not?

02:09:22.638 --> 02:09:23.472
Brother in law...

02:09:23.597 --> 02:09:27.267
How could you smile when
you have such grudge on us?

02:09:27.476 --> 02:09:29.436
Just for the property! Ain't it evident?

02:09:34.024 --> 02:09:39.154
I prioritised your happiness
over my own daughter's.

02:09:39.530 --> 02:09:40.906
-Sister!
-Don't talk to me!

02:09:41.532 --> 02:09:42.908
What can he say now, sister?

02:09:43.367 --> 02:09:46.119
He didn't even shed a tear
when father passed away.

02:09:46.370 --> 02:09:48.247
And now, our lives wouldn't
even matter to him.

02:09:52.751 --> 02:09:54.002
Neelaveni, take Nithya inside.

02:09:54.586 --> 02:09:55.420
Let her stay.

02:09:55.963 --> 02:09:59.466
Even she should know who are our family
members and outsiders here.

02:10:01.468 --> 02:10:02.678
They are your siblings.

02:10:03.512 --> 02:10:05.013
What will you gain by ditching them?

02:10:05.180 --> 02:10:08.267
Don't you have any conscience to do this?

02:10:08.684 --> 02:10:11.144
He convinced us to file a
case on Bose Babu first.

02:10:11.562 --> 02:10:15.232
We trusted him because
he is well educated and is an MRO.

02:10:18.068 --> 02:10:23.949
I promised your father that no one
will know that Bose is my son.

02:10:25.033 --> 02:10:25.993
Now, because of you...

02:10:26.618 --> 02:10:27.452
Mother...

02:10:27.494 --> 02:10:28.829
Don't call me mother.

02:10:42.634 --> 02:10:43.677
-Hey...
-Nithu!

02:10:46.180 --> 02:10:48.682
Uncle, aren't we a family?

02:10:55.772 --> 02:10:56.607
I'm not sure, dear.

02:11:15.584 --> 02:11:16.752
Tiru,

02:11:17.753 --> 02:11:20.255
the reason I am here in not
about discussing our disputes.

02:11:22.257 --> 02:11:23.550
Chandra's life should be happy.

02:11:27.387 --> 02:11:28.597
Tell me what should I do for that.

02:11:33.268 --> 02:11:34.978
I want my brother to walk
normally just as old days.

02:11:39.316 --> 02:11:40.651
I want my father to come back alive.

02:11:42.152 --> 02:11:43.362
I want your little brother dead.

02:11:44.488 --> 02:11:45.322
Will that happen?

02:11:49.493 --> 02:11:51.703
Don't you meddle with
my little brother!

02:11:51.995 --> 02:11:52.829
Is it?

02:11:55.582 --> 02:11:56.542
-Can I meddle with her?
-[groaning in pain]

02:11:56.875 --> 02:11:58.252
-Huh!
-Uncle!

02:11:58.710 --> 02:11:59.795
[groaning in pain]

02:12:00.087 --> 02:12:01.964
I will hack her right in front of you.

02:12:03.465 --> 02:12:04.299
[glass shatters]

02:12:04.550 --> 02:12:05.384
Hey... Tiru!

02:12:05.551 --> 02:12:06.385
[bellows]

02:12:08.595 --> 02:12:10.472
I'm taking my niece to my home.

02:12:12.391 --> 02:12:13.433
Bose!

02:12:17.145 --> 02:12:18.522
I will not let you go!

02:12:18.856 --> 02:12:19.690
Hey Koti!

02:12:26.238 --> 02:12:27.072
Smack him!

02:12:29.074 --> 02:12:29.908
Smack him off!

02:12:30.909 --> 02:12:31.869
Uncle!

02:12:34.079 --> 02:12:34.913
Watch this.

02:12:35.289 --> 02:12:36.123
Uncle!

02:12:39.960 --> 02:12:41.253
Watch this.

02:12:41.336 --> 02:12:42.337
Come on, watch this.

02:12:43.005 --> 02:12:44.464
Uncle Bose...

02:12:46.758 --> 02:12:48.135
Kill her. Just kill her!

02:12:48.760 --> 02:12:50.262
-Let's bury her!-Let go of him!

02:12:57.895 --> 02:12:59.229
Tiru, catch her!

02:13:24.213 --> 02:13:25.047
[switch clicks]

02:13:33.680 --> 02:13:35.724
[screaming in pain]

02:13:36.934 --> 02:13:37.893
Let go of me!

02:13:39.520 --> 02:13:40.562
Let go of me!

02:13:59.289 --> 02:14:01.500
We should make sure that no one in
the village knows about her death.

02:14:01.625 --> 02:14:02.835
Are you planning to give a tip-off?

02:14:10.384 --> 02:14:12.010
When sister Kumari asked
me to take you in my arms

02:14:12.052 --> 02:14:14.555
I felt that she asked me
to take her responsibility.

02:14:15.722 --> 02:14:17.349
It was the responsibility of an uncle!

02:14:18.600 --> 02:14:20.811
I'll be by your side through
all good and bad times.

02:14:23.272 --> 02:14:26.400
Turn on the switch...
and the light would glow.

02:14:29.319 --> 02:14:33.115
I will bury him here and
take you home, Chandramma.

02:14:38.412 --> 02:14:44.293
[bird chirping]

02:14:56.054 --> 02:14:57.639
[vehicle vrooms]

02:15:10.194 --> 02:15:12.738
[tyres screech]

02:15:26.919 --> 02:15:28.003
Come!

02:15:57.074 --> 02:15:57.908
Chandra!

02:16:00.244 --> 02:16:01.828
Uncle!

02:16:01.995 --> 02:16:05.999
[weeping]

02:16:06.500 --> 02:16:07.876
I'm here,
everything will be alright.

02:16:10.879 --> 02:16:11.964
Uncle Bose...

02:16:13.215 --> 02:16:14.216
Uncle Bose...

02:16:14.550 --> 02:16:15.509
Hey Jagadee!

02:16:16.510 --> 02:16:17.344
Your brother!

02:16:17.511 --> 02:16:18.345
Uncle...

02:16:25.060 --> 02:16:25.686
Your brother!

02:16:25.769 --> 02:16:27.771
That is what I'm saying! He is my brother!

02:16:30.232 --> 02:16:31.066
Tiru!

02:16:35.070 --> 02:16:35.904
[groans in pain]

02:16:36.446 --> 02:16:37.781
Hey, slit his throat.

02:16:51.086 --> 02:16:51.920
Brother!

02:17:05.601 --> 02:17:08.312
Hey! You'll pay for killing my brother!

02:17:13.233 --> 02:17:15.444
I made a mistake by getting
Chandra married to him.

02:17:18.697 --> 02:17:20.866
Now, I want you to handle him.

02:17:23.869 --> 02:17:25.078
Watch now!

02:17:25.412 --> 02:17:26.830
Hack them off!

02:17:42.804 --> 02:17:44.806
Hey...

02:17:57.152 --> 02:17:58.237
[groans in pain]

02:18:22.469 --> 02:18:24.805
Bose, you wanted to take your niece.

02:18:25.097 --> 02:18:27.182
I will not stop you.
Take her with you. Just take her off.

02:18:28.141 --> 02:18:29.184
Of course, I'll take her home.

02:18:29.560 --> 02:18:31.395
But our family has a tradition.

02:18:32.145 --> 02:18:35.023
A girl shouldn't be taken back to
parents' home when her husband is alive.

02:18:36.233 --> 02:18:37.568
What shall we do with him, Chandramma?

02:18:39.111 --> 02:18:40.445
Take me home, Uncle.

02:18:50.831 --> 02:18:51.999
Why make our hands dirty, Brother?

02:18:53.125 --> 02:18:54.501
The Naxalites will take care of him.

02:18:55.002 --> 02:18:55.836
[gasps]

02:18:56.545 --> 02:18:57.379
[engine starts]

02:19:07.639 --> 02:19:11.393
He took all the blame for our
mistakes and underwent agony.

02:19:13.562 --> 02:19:15.772
It is my fault that
Chandra's life is wrecked.

02:19:18.358 --> 02:19:20.110
I did terrible injustice to her.

02:19:21.236 --> 02:19:22.613
It is nothing terrible now, Brother.

02:19:23.280 --> 02:19:26.325
Chandra returned from Lanka, not Ayodhya.

02:19:27.326 --> 02:19:28.452
Let's be happy for that.

02:19:28.827 --> 02:19:31.496
We berated you without any contemplation.

02:19:36.502 --> 02:19:38.587
We could not understand you, Jagadee.

02:19:39.087 --> 02:19:41.423
We paid heed to some Tom Dick and Harry...

02:19:41.715 --> 02:19:43.091
It's alright, Brother-in-law.

02:19:45.385 --> 02:19:49.181
Hard times like these will let us
know how strong we are as a family.

02:19:50.098 --> 02:19:50.933
And it is proven.

02:19:52.726 --> 02:19:54.269
You'll hold nothing against us

02:19:55.395 --> 02:19:57.272
and be normal like regular you,
won't you, little Brother?

02:19:57.981 --> 02:19:58.899
Sister!

02:19:59.149 --> 02:20:03.362
We feared that you'd
desert us for mistreating you.

02:20:04.988 --> 02:20:06.698
I will be with you till my last breath.

02:20:07.824 --> 02:20:08.867
If you don't agree for that,

02:20:15.666 --> 02:20:17.459
I will send court notices for real.

02:20:28.804 --> 02:20:33.809
Father is within you.
From now, you are our world.

02:20:54.037 --> 02:20:57.541
I abused you in a way which
no mother would do that.

02:20:58.375 --> 02:21:02.504
You never spoke against it
or tried explaining.

02:21:03.005 --> 02:21:05.591
But you'd have felt at least once that

02:21:06.425 --> 02:21:09.803
you wouldn't have undergone all
this if your mother was alive.

02:21:19.646 --> 02:21:21.899
You are my only mother.

02:21:23.066 --> 02:21:24.443
This is the life which you have raised.

02:21:25.402 --> 02:21:27.946
I can see affection in your eyes...

02:21:28.530 --> 02:21:31.783
but am unable to
apprehend the pain in your heart.

02:21:37.164 --> 02:21:39.291
Father used to quote
something all the time.

02:21:53.805 --> 02:21:56.642
GOVERNMENT GUEST HOUSE

02:21:57.226 --> 02:22:00.938
[birds chirping]

02:22:06.109 --> 02:22:07.110
Madam...

02:22:07.653 --> 02:22:08.612
What is it?

02:22:08.820 --> 02:22:11.114
I don't know where your
husband worked earlier.

02:22:11.657 --> 02:22:13.492
Didn't you hear about this village?

02:22:13.825 --> 02:22:15.536
This is Pothuraju Metta.

02:22:17.538 --> 02:22:19.998
I don't know who your previous boss was.

02:22:20.290 --> 02:22:21.792
Well, I doubt whether you
have heard about my husband.

02:22:22.209 --> 02:22:23.335
He is Jagadish Naidu.

02:22:23.502 --> 02:22:24.586
People call him Tuck Jagadish.
